/*
 * Reciprocal Net project

 * CvsInvoker.java
 *
 * 29-May-2003: ekoperda wrote first draft
 * 03-Jul-2003: ekoperda added getFileRevision() and modified 
 *              commitModifiedFile() to succeed even if the target file's 
 *              contents have not changed
 * 06-Aug-2003: midurbin added getFileHeadRevision() and
 *              replaceFileWithRevision()
 * 14-Aug-2003: midurbin/ekoperda fixed bug #1020 in registerDirectory()
 * 20-Jun-2006: jobollin updated docs; modified commitAddedFile() to attempt
 *              to persevere in spite of errors druing a "cvs add" operation
 * 06-Nov-2006: jobollin fixed bug #1804 (partially reversing the previous
 *              change) by making commitAddedFile detect and process CVS's
 *              error response when it is asked to add a file that already
 *              exists 
 * 07-Jan-2008: ekoperda improved commitAddedFile() to be more tolerant of 
 *              inconsistencies
