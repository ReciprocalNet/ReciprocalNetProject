           In general, all computations in the IUMSC are done on IBM compatible microcomputers.  Thus, most of the data files
           are in formats that are readable by IBM compatible systems.  Most critical data are in ASCII format.  If a structure
           completed in the IUMSC has been placed in the IUMSC Web data libraries, the hyperlink &quot;Report and Data files for
           nnnnn&quot; from the crystal data summary page will list the files that are available.  The following define the contents of the

           <p>The compressed (<i>nnnnnlb.zip</i>) library can be downloaded to an IBM compatible system and uncompressed using the PKUNZIP.EXE utility from PKWare.  The shareware version of the PKWare software is available in the XTEL library.  The following describes the files that are available in each library.</p><br/>

           <p class="heading">Indiana University Molecular Structure Center <i>Zip</i> Libraries.</p>
           <br/><div class ="bar3"></div><br/>
           <p>For each crystal structure determined at the Indiana University Molecular Structure Center a condensed library file 9nnnnlb.zip is saved.  This condensed file is created using software (PKZIP) from PKWARE, 9025 North Deerwood Drive, Brown Deer, WI 53223.</p>
           <p>All condensed and binary files are for IBM compatible systems. </p>
           <p>The typical structure center library, saved as <i>9nnnnlb.zip</i> on the IUMSC web server contains many or all of the files listed and defined below.  Note that each crystallographer at the IUMSC has personal preferences regarding files that are saved.  Note that a few files not listed below may be contained in the libraries.   They have been saved for the convenience of the crystallographer and should be fairly self-explanatory to anyone familiar with x-ray crystallography. It is also important to note that over the years some of the files have changed slightly.  In most cases all older files are still compatible with present programs.</p>

           <div class ="bar3"></div><br/>
           <p><i><b>9nnnn.rep</b></i> The structure center report, put together by the  program MSCREP.  This is the report as you know it, without graphics and without the summary file.</p>
           <p><i><b>9nnnn.sum</b></i> Summary file for the report.  For newer structures it will be written in WordPerfect (several versions are or have been used), for older structures in WordStar.</p>
           <p><i><b>9nnnn</b></i> Final standard data tape (T21F) put together, i. e. the tape contains the full contents of the asymmetric unit.  It does not contain atoms related by crystallographic symmetry. Atoms   related by crystallographic symmetry can be generated using SHORTEP.</p>
           <p><i><b>9nnnnA</b></i> The standard data tape with the suffix A, usually contains the complete molecule of interest.  It has been put together using the crystallographic symmetry, either by using the           BUILD command in SHORTEP or by using the appropriate 401, 405 and 406 commands.  This tape is used for the ORTEP plots.  Different crystallographers at the IUMSC may use a different    nomenclature.  JCH, for example, uses T20A for the ORTEP plots in the report.</p>
           <p><i><b>9nnnnAXH</b></i> This tape is again the complete molecule of interest, hydrogen atom coordinates have been changed so that the C-H bondlength is lengthened to 1.08A, the isotropic thermal parameter for H is set to 0.5.   This tape is usually used for space-filling plots, and also for ORTEP plots.</p>
           <p>If the asymmetric unit contains more than one complete molecule, a molecule plus solvent molecule(s), or anion(s) and cation(s),  there may be files labelled 9nnnnB, 9nnnnC, etc.  Some of these files were created for the convenience of the crystallographer, perhaps for special plots for the report.  They can all be  regenerated by using the 9nnnn tape and SHORTEP.</p>
           <p><i><b>agnost.inp</b></i> Input file for the absorption correction program AGNOST.  File contains the orientation matrix for the crystal, as well as the indices of the crystal faces and their distances to a common center in the crystal, in cm, and the linear absorption coefficient mu for the molecule.</p>

           <p><i><b>ang.drx</b></i> Angle file created by the SEEK program in PCPS.  File is used as input to the DIRAX program.  DIRAX is an indexing program written by Albert J. M. Duisenberg, Acta Cryst (1992) 25, 92-96.</p>
           <p><i><b>ang.dxo</b></i> Output file created by the DIRAX program.  It shows the original choice of unit cell made by DIRAX, this may not necessarily be the unit cell used for the solution and refinement of the structure.</p>

           <p><i><b>angs.out</b></i> File containing angles used for the ORTEP-plots in the report.  This file is generated from the plotting program COMM.  Each time a 10 instruction is issued a set of angles for the particular orientation is saved to the angs.out file.

           <p><i><b>anyda.out</b></i> Output from program ANYDA. File contains distances and angles not included in Table 5.  File is normally edited and included in the report as Table(n).</p>
           <p><i><b>app2 </b></i> File used by KFS.  It is an Appendix to Table 2 of the report, containing details of the absorption correction. WES uses Table2a for this information.</p>
           <p><i><b>avoid.out </b></i> File created by the program AVOID.  This program is used when checking a completed structure for areas (voids) where a poorly defined solvent molecule might be.  This file may also be saved as Table of Molecular Packing Analysis.</p>

           <p><i><b>t20a</b></i> Standard data tape containing the molecule of interest.  See 9nnnnA above.  This file is used for the ORTEP plots by JCH.</p>
           <p><i><b>t21 </b></i>or<i><b> t21f</b></i> Final T21 from the least-squares refinement program.  Note this tape contains all of the atoms in the asymmetric unit, but are not necessarily together (a flaw in the GENLES program).  The atoms can be put together using the SHORTEP program, either by using the BUILD instruction or by suitable 401, 405 and 406 instructions.</p>
           <p><i><b>t3</b></i> Binary file used for by the distance and angle calculation program DIS250.  T3 contains the variance-covariance matrix from the least-squares program GEN250 (GENLES).  T3 is not normally saved.</p>
           <p><i><b>t4</b></i> Output file from the least-squares progarm GEN250.  File is used for creating the Appendix of Fo and Fc, also known as OUTFO or 9nnnn.FO.  T4 is not normally saved.</p>
           <p><i><b>t6</b></i> Final data file as used for the least-squares refinement.   File contains h, k, l, I, sig(I), scalefactor #, and rho.  rho is defined as (sin(theta)/lambda)**2.</p>
           <p><i><b>t8</b></i> Output file from the least-squares refinement program GEN250. Contains data used for calculation of electron density maps. T8 is not normally saved.</p>
           <p><i><b>t30</b></i> Final T30 from the least-squares refinement program, GEN250.  This tape contains the final atomic parameters with their standard deviations.  This tape is used for generating OUT30, Tables 3  and 4 for the report.  Files such as T30A, T30B, etc. are intermediate tapes, they are saved at the convenience of the crystallographer.</p>
           <p><i><b>t30f</b></i> Final T30 from the least-squares refinement program, GEN250.  This tape contains the final atomic parameters with their standard deviations, and is used for generating tables 3 and 4 in the report..  If the structure has been refined in a 'cyclical' manner the tape will have been put together by the crystallographer.</p>
           <p><i><b>table(n)</b> </i>Occasionally the report contains additional tables, e. g. least-squares planes, special contact distances, hydrogen bonding etc.</p>
           <p><i><b>table2a</b></i> File used by WES for absorption correction data.</p>
           <p><i><b>tabout</b></i> This file is Table 2 from the report.  It contains details of the data collection, data reduction, experimental set-up, and refinement of the structure.</p>
           <p><i><b>tape20</b></i> Standard data tape used as input file to several programs. It is not normally saved.</p>
           <p><i><b>tape21</b></i> Standard data tape from the final least-squares refinement.  This tape contains the coordinates of all atoms in the asymmetric unit put together.  This tape is the one used with T30F to create Tables 3 and 4 in the report, it is also the tape  commonly listed as Table 6 in the report.</p>
           <p><i><b>tape22</b></i> Standard data tape containing the coordinates of two molecules or fragments fitted together using the BMFIT program.  The coordinates of the second molecule are given in the unit cell of the first molecule.  When plotted with the COMM program the use of a 13 n instruction will allow the first n atoms to be plotted as a separate unit (usually one molecule in white and the other in red).</p>
           <p><i><b>tors.sum</b></i> File containing torsion angles for the compound. Note: As of May 1995 we are not computing standard deviations for the torsion angles.</p>
           <p><i><b>xtaldt</b></i> Standard data tape file created by the program AGNOS.  It contains the vertices of the crystal shape used for the absorption correction.  Can be plotted using ORTEP and the special ORTEP.INP file also created by AGNOS.</p>
