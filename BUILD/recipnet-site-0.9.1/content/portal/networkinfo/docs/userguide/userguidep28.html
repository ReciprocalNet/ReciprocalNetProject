</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>You should already have
logged in to the web application and created a provider record, as was described
in the preceding section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first step in creating a
new Reciprocal Net sample is to create its metadata record using the web
application.  Click the <B><I>Submit Sample</B></I>
button on the menu bar to go to the submission form.  Notice that the lab with which your user account
is associated is being recorded in the sample’s metadata.  In the next field you should choose the provider
that delivered this crystal sample to you. 
You may create new provider records, if needed, via the <B><I>Administrative Tools</B></I>
feature that was described above.  A
sample’s associated provider cannot be changed once the sample record has been
created.  You may enter the sample’s
anticipated empirical formula, if the provider gave you some idea what it might
be.  You may also enter the name of the
person within the provider’s lab who actually delivered the sample to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every Reciprocal Net sample
must be assigned a unique <I>sample number</I>
that identifies the sample within the context of your lab.  It is not necessary for your sample number to
be globally unique (across all of the Reciprocal Net Site Network), just for it
to be unique within your lab.  The sample
number may be up to 32 characters long and may contain letters and symbols if
you like.  Many crystallography labs
prefer to use a separate system for tracking samples submitted, using their own
ID numbers.  If your lab fits into this
category you’ll want to specify that tracking number here.  Or, you could configure your server to
auto-generate sequential sample numbers according to rules you specify.  (See page 46.)  It is very not possible to change a sample
number once the sample record has been created, so choose wisely.  Enter any comments you like and then click
the <B><I>Submit</B></I>
button.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your browser should be
delivered to the <B><I>Edit
sample</B></I> page, where you can see details about this sample
record and make changes to it.  The next
step in creating a new sample is to create its data directory in the
repository; it’s easiest if you do this via the web application.  Scroll to near the bottom of the <B><I>Edit sample</B></I>
page, in the section that begins with a message something like <B><I>No files for xxx in repository</B></I>.  Every sample should have a corresponding
directory in the repository where the sample’s data files can be stored.  In a default site software installation, the
files are stored somewhere beneath <B><I>/var/recipnet/data/</B></I>, usually
under a directory named for the sample’s originating lab and then under a
directory named for the sample number. 
Every sample has its own data directory, and this directory name must
match the sample number.  Some labs find
it more convenient to organize their sample data directories into deeper
hierarchies (perhaps with sample directories grouped into parent directories
according to the year they were created, for example).  This is an optional feature, but if you
choose to use it you’ll need to specify the “grouping directory” name in this
box.  If you do not wish to use this
feature, and you’re satisfied with all your sample data directories living in
the same parent directory without any additional hierarchy, you may safely
leave this box blank.  Click the <B><I>Create</B></I> button
to continue.  The section of the <B><I>Edit sample</B></I>
page that displayed a warning message before now contains a list of all the
data files associated with this sample. 
No files will appear in this section, however, until you upload them to
the server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After you have submitted a
new sample record and created its directory in the repository, the next thing
you do to a real-world crystal sample is put it on your diffractometer and collect
some data.  Once data collection has
completed, you’ll want to return to the <B><I>Edit sample</B></I> page in the web app
and click the <B><I>Collect
preliminary data</B></I> link in the menu at the bottom of the page.  The <B><I>Collect preliminary data</B></I> page
gives you an opportunity to record information garnered from the collection
operation – all fields are optional.  You
may specify the name of the crystallographer who collected the data (if more
than one crystallographer was involved you may enter several names), the unit
cell parameters (these can be changed later), the temperature at which data was
gathered, a short (one-word) description of the crystal’s color, and general
comments about the collection operation. 
Click the <B><I>Save</B></I>
button when you’ve finished filling out the form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once data has been collected
from the real-world crystal sample and the operation recorded within the
recipnet web app, the next step is usually to solve the structure and refine it.  Unfortunately Reciprocal Net cannot help you
with this part.  But once the structure
has been refined, be sure to visit the <B><I>Edit sample</B></I> page and click the <B><I>Refine structure</B></I>
link.  The <B><I>Refine structure</B></I> page allows you
to record more information about the sample – again all fields are
optional.  The unit cell parameters
specified on the <B><I>Collect
preliminary data </B></I>page previously may be changed here; you may
enter a summary of the structure if you wish; you may enter z and the space
group, several  statistical indicators of
your data’s accuracy (goodness of fit, RF, R(F<sup>2</sup>), RWF, RW(F<sup>2</sup>)), and
an empirical formula, structural formula, moiety formula, SMILES code, trade
name, common name, and IUPAC (formal) name. 
Enter information in as many of these fields as you’re able and then hit
the <B><I>Save</B></I>
button.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your sample record is now in
the <I>Complete</I> state and might stay this way for many
months or years.  The sample’s provider,
if he has a user account on your site, will be able to look his sample up and
access the data you collected, as will fellow staffers who at your
crystallography lab.  Now is a good time
to attach data files to your sample – like an industry-standard <B><I>cif</B></I> file or a <B><I>crt</B></I> file so
that JaMM will work.  All data files
associated with samples that you create are stored on your server in the <I>repository</I>,
somewhere beneath the directory <B><I>/var/recipnet/data/</B></I>.  For instance, if you gave your sample the
number ‘123’ and the name of your lab was ‘abc’, and you chose not to use a
“grouping directory”, all the sample’s data files should be placed in the
directory <B><I>/var/recipnet/data/xyz/123/</B></I>.  This directory should have already been
created when you clicked the <B><I>Create</B></I> button earlier in this
section.  (Due to potential permissions
and security issues, the site software web application is the preferred method
for creating repository directories.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may upload data files to
the server from your desktop computer via any of several mechanisms.  Click the <B><I>Upload files</B></I> button near the
lower-left corner of the page.  You’ll
see the <B><I>Upload
Files</B></I> page, where you can upload up to five files from your
desktop computer to the server.  Click a <B><I>Browse</B></I> button,
choose a file from your local system, and click the <B><I>Upload now</B></I>
button.  The file is uploaded and a
confirmation page appears.  Subsequently
you see the Manage Files page, which lists all sample data files attached to
the sample and can manipulate them as need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another method for uploading
files is via dragging-and-dropping to the web application.  This is particularly effective if you have
many files to transfer at once.  On the <B><I>Manage Files</B></I>
page, look in the lower-right corner and click on the link for <B><I>Upload files (Drag-and-Drop)</B></I>.  The next page that appears contains a Java
applet that helps you upload files.  (If
you see a security warning, please authorize the applet to run.)  Arrange the windows on your screen so that
you see both the web page and your local computer’s file manager at the same
time.  Find a sample data file that you
wish to upload within your desktop computer’s file manager.  Click on a file icon, drag the file into your
web browser window, and drop the file onto the applet.  A progress bar appears and the file is
uploaded to the server.  You can repeat
the procedure for several files.  You
also can select several files on your desktop and drag all of them to the
applet at once.  When you’ve finished,
click the <B><I>Save</B></I>
button.  A moment later you should see
the <B><I>Manage Files</B></I>
page again.  Look in the lower-right
corner and click the link <B><I>Back
to “Edit Sample”</B></I>. 
Notice that links to the sample’s attached data files have appeared on
the bottom-left side of the page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are other ways to
transfer sample data files to your server as well.  Reciprocal Net site software automatically
detects and recognizes sample data files that are deposited into existing
repository directories on the server’s filesystem.  Thus, services like <B><I>ftp</B></I>, <B><I>ssh</B></I> (and
related utilities), <B><I>nfs</B></I>,
<B><I>samba</B></I>,
etc. are useful for this purpose.  Pretty
much any of these mechanisms will require that the user transferring data files
have a GNU/Linux user account on the server and write permissions on at least
some portion of the repository.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last step in dealing with
a Reciprocal Net sample is releasing it to the public.  This is the chief motivation behind the
Reciprocal Net site software – making it as easy as possible for you to
contribute your samples to the distributed public collection.  In deference to intellectual property issues,
most labs choose to publish samples on Reciprocal Net only after the same
structure has been published in a trade journal (usually by the sample’s
provider), possibly several years after the Reciprocal Net sample reached the <I>complete</I>
state.  This ensures that the
prior-publication rights of the sample provider are not infringed.  Reciprocal Net also encourages its member labs
to institute a policy that samples that have gone unpublished for five years or
more (for example) are automatically released to the public by the crystallography
lab staff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To release a sample to the
public, go to the <B><I>Edit
sample</B></I> page and click the <B><I>Release to public</B></I> link.  The <B><I>Release to public</B></I> page allows you
to enter a few additional metadata items (all optional): a layman’s explanation
of the sample’s real-world significance, a preferred name if there are several
from which to choose, a copyright notice for your data and metadata, and
comments about why the sample is being released to the public.  The layman’s explanation is particularly
valuable if you intend to contribute your sample to the “Common molecules
collection” maintained by Reciprocalnet.org but may be of limited use
otherwise.  The copyright notice is
optional, but if you find your lab’s employees typing the same notice for many
samples, you might want to go to <B><I>Administrative Tools</B></I> and <B><I>Edit lab</B></I> to
change the default copyright notice that appears on samples released from your
lab.  Click the <B><I>Submit</B></I> button
to release the sample to the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unauthenticated visitors to
your web site now will see the sample in the searches they run, and your sample
will be indexed by the distributed search engine on Reciprocalnet.org very soon.  Congratulations on releasing your first
sample.</p>
