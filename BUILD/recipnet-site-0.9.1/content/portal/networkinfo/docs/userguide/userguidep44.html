<p class=MsoNormal>A <B><I>.crt</B></I>
data file contains a representation of some part of a crystal structure,
whether one or more particular molecules, the contents of a unit cell, or some
other part of the structure as chosen by the file’s creator.  The contents describe atoms, the bonds
between them, and optionally the unit cell dimensions and symmetry operations
of the structure from which the data are drawn. 
Atom positions are expressed as Cartesian x, y, and z coordinates (in
units of Ångstroms), hence the <B><I>.crt</B></I> extension.  Symmetry and unit cell information is
referred to the same Cartesian system.  Among
other uses, <B><I>.crt</B></I>
files may be visualized using the JaMM family of applets included with the
Reciprocal Net site software.  The file
format was developed by <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indiana</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> in the 1990’s;
it is textual in nature, so <B><I>.crt</B></I> files can readily be manipulated
via a standard editor.</p>


<h3><B><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="000080"><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME="T2">Basic definitions</A></FONT></FONT></FONT></B></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l36 level1 lfo23;
tab-stops:list .75in'>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each octet in the file must represent an ASCII
character (in the range 0-127).  Except
as otherwise specified by this document, character codes 32 or less are
prohibited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l36 level1 lfo23;
tab-stops:list .75in'>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A line break may consist of a carriage return character
(ASCII code 13), a line feed (ASCII code 10), or a carriage return followed
immediately by a line feed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l36 level1 lfo23;
tab-stops:list .75in'>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The characters space (ASCII code 32) and tab (ASCII
code 9) are considered white space. 
Tokens are elements of the file separated by one or more consecutive
white space characters.  The precise
number of white space characters separating two tokens is not significant.  Additionally, a line break character may
separate two tokens, optionally with white space on either side, when the
specification calls for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l36 level1 lfo23;
tab-stops:list .75in'>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pound sign character (ASCII code 35, <B><I>‘#’</B></I>) signifies
a comment.  All characters from the pound
sign to the next line break (or end of file, if there is no next line break)
are ignored by parsers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l36 level1 lfo23;
tab-stops:list .75in'>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A numeric value consists of a string of decimal digits
(characters <B><I>‘0’</B></I>
through <B><I>‘9’</B></I>,
ASCII codes 48 through 57), the decimal point (ASCII code 46), and the negative
sign (ASCII code 45).  If a negative sign
is present then it must be the first character of the value.  Real number values may contain at most one
decimal point and are stored with at least the precision of the IEEE “single
precision” standard format; this guarantees at least six significant decimal
digits of precision.  Integer values may
not contain a decimal point and are stored with at least the precision of
32-bit two’s-complement format.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l36 level1 lfo23;
tab-stops:list .75in'>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A textual value consists of between one and thirty-one
sequential characters in the range 33-127, except that double quote (ASCII code
34), pound sign (ASCII code 35), and backslash (ASCII code 47) characters are
not permitted.</p>


<h3><B><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="000080"><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME="T3">Sections</A></FONT></FONT></FONT></B></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The file is divided into sections, some of which are
optional.  Order of sections is
significant, and those present MUST appear in the order they are listed below.  At present, three sections are defined, but
parsers SHOULD be tolerant of additional (unrecognized) sections that may be
present at the bottom of a <B><I>.crt</B></I>
file.</p>


<h3><B><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="000080"><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME="T4">The CARTESIAN section</A></FONT></FONT></FONT></B></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This section enumerates the atoms in the asymmetric
unit of the structure, locates them in 3-space, and identifies any bonds
between them.  It is the only required
section, and it must be first in the file. 
It is composed of three subsections:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l30 level1 lfo25;
tab-stops:list 1.25in'>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A header line consisting of the word <B><I>CARTESIAN</B></I>, an
integer count of the atoms that will be described by this section (subsection
2), an integer count of the bonds that will be described by this section
(subsection 3), and a textual label for the file.  Each value is separated from its neighbor by
white space.  The subsection is
terminated by a line break.  Atom and
bond counts listed in this section SHOULD be considered advisory rather than
prescriptive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l30 level1 lfo25;
tab-stops:list 1.25in'>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ATOMS subsection contains zero or more atom definitions,
one per line, starting on the line immediately after the one line of subsection
1.  Each atom description consists of a
textual label, a real number that represents the atom’s x-coordinate, a real
number that represents the atom’s y-coordinate, a real number that represents
the atom’s z-coordinate, and an integer that represents the atomic number of
the atom.  Version
0.9.0 adds an additional, optional site code tag at the end of each atom line
(see below).  Each value is
separated from its neighbor by white space. 
Any additional tokens on an atom line SHOULD be ignored by parsers.  The order of atom descriptions within this
subsection is not externally significant, but the bond definitions in subsection
3 refer to this order.  This subsection
is terminated by a line starting with the word <B><I>ENDATOMS</B></I>; the remainder of this
line SHOULD be ignored by parsers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal >Site codes describe the relationship of atom
records in the CRT file to crystallographic sites described in some external
file, normally a CIF.  They have the form
of an atom site label, bar (‘|’, ASCII code 124) character, and CIF-style symmetry
code (see the CIF dictionary) concatenated together, with any internal
whitespace characters removed.  Example:
C10|2_455.  Specific interpretation of
these codes relies on reference to a corresponding external file, and unless
the appropriate such file can be identified (normally by means of some local
convention) it is safest to ignore these codes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l30 level1 lfo25;
tab-stops:list 1.25in'>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The BONDS subsection contains zero or more bond descriptions,
one per line, each connecting two atoms in the model as identified by 1-based
indices into the atom list of subsection 2. 
Bond descriptions consist simply of the two integer indices, separated
by white space.  Parsers SHOULD ignore
the remainder of each line.  Order of
atom indices within a bond description and the order of bond descriptions
within the subsection are not significant. 
Duplicate bond descriptions (in the same or the reverse order of atom
indices) are permitted but not meaningful; they SHOULD be accommodated by
parsers but not expected.  This subsection
is terminated by a line starting with the word <B><I>ENDBONDS</B></I>; the remainder of this
line SHOULD be ignored by parsers.</p>


<h3><B><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="000080"><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME="T5">The CELL section</A></FONT></FONT></FONT></B></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This optional section describes the origin and unit
cell vectors of the structure in terms of the Cartesian system to which the
coordinates of the atoms in the <B><I>CARTESIAN</B></I> section are referred.  This section is recognized by the keyword <B><I>CELL</B></I> as the
first word of a line; the remainder of this line SHOULD be ignored by
parsers.  The rest of the section
consists of four lines, each containing three real numbers constituting the
coordinates of a point or vector in Cartesian space, separated by white space:
the origin of the crystallographic coordinate system on the first line, then
the <v:shape id="_x0000_i1163" type="#_x0000_t75"

three lines.  Parsers MAY require that
the last four lines of this section be devoid of other tokens.  There is no explicit terminator for this
section; the end is implicit in the fixed number of lines the section contains.</p>


<h3><B><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="000080"><FONT FACE="Arial"><A NAME="T6">The SYMMETRY section</A></FONT></FONT></FONT></B></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This optional section describes symmetry operations of
the structure from which the model described in this CRT file is drawn,
referred to the same Cartesian system in which the atomic coordinates are
expressed.  The identity operation is
implied and MUST NOT be included in this section.  This section is identified by the keyword <B><I>SYMMETRY</B></I> as the
first word of a line.  An integer count
of the symmetry operations that will be described by this section follows the
keyword on the same line, separated by white space; this count SHOULD be
treated as advisory, not prescriptive. 
The remainder of the line SHOULD be ignored by parsers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The body of the section consists of zero or more
symmetry operation descriptions, each comprising four lines of three whitespace-delimited
real numbers.  The first three lines of
each description contain the elements of the three rows of a 3-by-3 rotation
matrix <I>M</I> (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), and the last row contains
the elements of a translation vector <v:shape id="_x0000_i1172"
