<p class=MsoNormal>The Reciprocal Net project
was started by a grant from the NSF in January 2002 and was integrated into the
National Science Digital Library (see <a
href="http://www.nsdl.org/">http://www.nsdl.org/</a></span>) in 2003.<span
>  The Reciprocal Net project currently is based
at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indiana</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, although we hope the effort
will evolve to a self-supporting, community-managed model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Reciprocal Net project,
so far as the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) is concerned, comprises
three <I>collections</I>:</p>

<p class=Normalbutnospace style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;
mso-list:l24 level1 lfo6;tab-stops:list 1.25in'>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A collection of
molecular structure data, where the structures solved and ready to be
visualized.  Submissions into this
collection originate from respected crystallography facilities, generally
affiliated with major universities.</p>

<p class=Normalbutnospace style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;
mso-list:l24 level1 lfo6;tab-stops:list 1.25in'>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A collection of
educational modules – sequences of web pages – that instruct students on
specific aspects of chemistry. 
Submissions into this collection originate from professional educators
in primary schools, secondary schools, and universities.</p>

<p class=Normalbutnospace style='margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;
mso-list:l24 level1 lfo6;tab-stops:list 1.25in'>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A collection of
visualization programs for rendering molecular structures.  Submissions into this collection generally
originate from computer programmers associated with the field of chemistry in
some way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The latter two collections
are managed entirely by Reciprocalnet.org, the “portal,” and are outside the
scope of this manual.  The first
collection, the one that contains molecular structures, is the focus of this
document.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Reciprocal Net <I>site
software</I>, distributed as the <B><I>recipnet</B></I> package, is designed to
be deployed at crystallography facilities and to integrate into their daily
workflows.  By using the Reciprocal Net
site software for their day-to-day operations, these crystallography facilities
have an easy means for contributing structures to Reciprocal Net’s public
collection.  To date, roughly 250,000
molecular structures have been published in the scientific literature.  How many more have been analyzed but never
made public because they weren’t sufficiently interesting?  Reciprocal Net is an outlet for all
structures, whether published or not.  As
a public educational resource, this comprehensive collection of molecular data
will be unparalleled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is safe for your
laboratory to use the Reciprocal Net site software even if it intends to make
only a few structures public at first – the software was designed for
this.  No one, not even the Reciprocal
Net Coordinator, can access structure data on your server to which you (the lab
administrator) have not permitted it. 
You control who may access data on a per-structure basis: whether only
fellow crystallographers in your lab, the chemist who submitted the crystal, or
the general public.  We recommend that
labs institute a policy that structure data analyzed by them becomes publicly
visible via Reciprocal Net when either a) the structure is published in a
scholarly journal, or b) after five years. 
In this way, intellectual property rights of the submitting chemist can
be preserved while the usefulness of Reciprocal Net as an educational resource continues
to grow.  (Of course, the five-year rule
is only a suggestion; the software will not make your structure data visible to
the public until you instruct it to do so.)</p>
