This is recipnetd's self-configuration mode.  You must have performed the
following tasks before running this utility.
    1. edited /etc/recipnet/recipnetd.conf to suit your local environment.
    2. obtained a recipnet.sitegrant file, placed it in /etc/recipnet,
       and set appropriate permissions.
    3. installed and started the MySQL database daemon.
    4. be logged in as 'root' right now.
If you haven't yet performed these tasks, please press Ctrl-C and correct
these errors first.

This utility will perform a number of one-time initialization tasks necessary
for recipnetd to interoperate with the MySQL database.
    1. A database named 'recipnet' will be created.  Its data files will be
       stored in /var/recipnet/db .  Any existing files there will be erased.
    2. The MySQL daemon will be restarted in order to activate the new
       database.
    3. A MySQL user account named 'recipnet_site' will be created, given a
       randomly-generated password, and granted full permissions on the
       'recipnet' database.
    4. A MySQL user account named 'recipnet_sample' will be created, given a
       randomly-generated password, and granted full permissions on the
       'recipnet' database.
    5. A MySQL user account named 'recipnet_repos' will be created, given a
       randomly-generated password, and granted full permissions on the
       'recipnet' database.  (If you later decide to change any of the three
       previous user account names or passwords, you will need to update the
       config file /etc/recipnet/recipnetd.conf also.)
    6. A number of tables will be created within the 'recipnet' database.
    7. The MySQL daemon will be restarted again so that the new user accounts
       are activated.
    8. Recipnetd will "bootstrap" itself by processing the recipnet.sitegrant
       file you received from the Reciprocal Net coordinator.
    9. The first Reciprocal Net site administrator account will be created
       for you, using a password that you specify.  You may use this first 
       admin account later to create other user accounts within Reciprocal Net.
