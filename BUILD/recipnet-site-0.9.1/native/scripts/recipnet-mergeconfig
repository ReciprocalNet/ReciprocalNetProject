#
# How to use this script
#
# This script is designed to help reconcile a locally customized version of the
# site software's /etc/recipnet/recipnetd.conf configuration file with the new,
# uncustomized version installed when the site software is updated via RPM.
# When such an update occurs, the original configuration file is renamed to
# /etc/recipnet/recipnetd.conf.rpmsave before the new one is installed.  This
# script is a front end to a utility program that uses the new config file as
# a template with default configuration property values, the old file as a
# collection of desired values, and a file of property overrides internal to the
# site software that force certain values to be set even if the properties had
# been customized in the old configuration file.
#
# This script must be run with root privileges so as to enable it to read the
# configuration files.  It takes no command-line arguments; just run it.  If
# everything goes correctly then a diagnostic summary will be printed to the
# script's output, along with suggestions as to what to do next.  The actual
# merged result will be written to /etc/recipnet/recipnetd.conf.merge.  (I.e.
# neither the current recipnetd.conf nor the saved one are modified.)  This
# script will terminate early without doing anything if the .rpmsave file
# doesn't exist, so it is harmless to run it when the original configuration
# file had not been modified.  
#
# This script can also be used to assist non-standard update operations such
# as a site software update combined with a hardware / OS change.  Just save
# the configuration properties you want to merge in (possibly a whole config
# file) as /etc/recipnet/recipnetd.conf.rpmsave, and then proceed as normal.
