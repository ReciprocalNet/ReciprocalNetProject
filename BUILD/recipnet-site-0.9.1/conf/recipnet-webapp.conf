# Reciprocal Net project
# recipnet-webapp.conf
#
# Configuration file for Apache Httpd 2 that tells it about the "Reciprocal Net
# site software" webapp.  In a Redhat-8.0 type system, this file belongs in
# /etc/httpd/conf.d.  The configuration directives contained herein are in the
# same format used in httpd.conf, the main configuration file for Httpd.  Some
# of the directives in this file require that mod_jk, from the Apache 
# Tomcat-connectors package, be installed and already configured on this
# server.
#
# 10-Oct-2002: ekoperda wrote first draft
# 13-Dec-2002: ekoperda fixed bug 653 by declaring that all .crt files have
#              a MIME type of application/octet-stream
# 11-Jun-2003: nsanghvi added two more arguments to the configuration 
#              directive RecipnetAuthConfig
# 25-Jul-2003: ekoperda changed RecipnetAuthEnable's enclosing Location to fix
#              bug 995
# 08-Apr-2004: ekoperda added auto-selection of mod_recipnet_auth version
# 15-Apr-2004: ekoperda fixed bug #1192 in auto-selection of mod_recipnet_auth
# 07-May-2004: cwestnea added argument to RecipnetAuthConfig for RMI port
# 02-Jul-2004: ekoperda added version of mod_recipnet_auth that's compatible
#              with httpd-2.0.49
# 27-Jul-2004: ekoperda added version of mod_recipnet_auth that's compatible
#              with httpd-2.0.50
# 11-Jan-2005: ekoperda simplified mod_recipnet_auth selection logic by 
#              considering only the major portion of the MMN
# 20-Oct-2005: midurbin corrected parameter ordering for RecipnetAuthConfig
# 13-Nov-2006: jobollin switched to using mod_proxy_ajp (for Apache 2.2)
#              instead of mod_jk
# 29-Dec-2007: ekoperda merged changes in from recipnet-webapp-ap22.conf
# 01-Jan-2008: ekoperda replaced mod_recipnet_auth with a new mechanism based
#              on mod_rewrite

# These directives instruct mod_proxy_ajp, cooperating with mod_proxy, to
# forward requests for certain content to Apache Tomcat to be serviced. 
# "Normal" content files like static html and gif files are not included in
# these rules and thus are served by Httpd like normal, though these exclusions
# are controlled on a per-"location" basis.

# The "data" directory is where data files that have been attached to samples
# are stored.  Access to these files is regulated by mod_rewrite and the
# ModRewriteAuthConnector in such a way that all files are inaccessible until
# the user has authenticated to the web app and been granted access to the
# particular sample.
#
# Some of the arguments below are configurable.  On the RewriteMap line, the
# arguments to the recipnet-authconnector program are as follows:
#     1. the network name of the host running recipnetd (e.g. 'localhost')
#     2. the port number of recipnetd's RMI server (e.g. '1099')
#     3. the RMI binding name within recipnetd
#     4. the number of URI's to cache (performance implications)
#     5. the duration to cache authorization decisions (milliseconds)
#
# Additionally, the final RewriteRule line below should be changed if you need
# to move the sample data files repository.
