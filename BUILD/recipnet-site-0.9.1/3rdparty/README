Reciprocal Net project
README for 3rdparty directory


The '3rdparty' directory contains source code written by external parties that
is used in at least some portion of the Reciprocal Net project.  Only the 
pristine copies of other groups' source code are included here - if the 
Reciprocal Net project made any patches or alterations to this software, those 
patches are NOT reflected in this directory.  Patches to the software in this 
directory, if they exist, would live elsewhere in the source tree and be 
applied at build time.  Check the buildfile for an authoritative answer on what
gets built and how.
