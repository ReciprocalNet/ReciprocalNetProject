MEDIAN(1)                USER COMMANDS                  MEDIAN(1)



NAME
     median - perform median cut on data in a VORT file

SYNOPSIS
     median [ -c size ] [ -f ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
     Median applys median cut to an RGB image stored in file1  to
     generate  the data in file2.  The colormap generated has, by
     default, 256 entries; this  may  be  modified  with  the  -c
     option.   By  default the image data is quantized by mapping
     each pixel to the closest color values in the colormap.   If
     the  -f  option  is  specified, Floyd-Steinberg dithering is
     done before selecting a colormap entry.
