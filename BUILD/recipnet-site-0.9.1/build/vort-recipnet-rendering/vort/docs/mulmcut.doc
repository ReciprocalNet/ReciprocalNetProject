NAME
     mulmcut - perform median cut on data in  one  or  more  VORT
     files

SYNOPSIS
     mulmcut [ -c size ] [ -f ] file1 file2...

DESCRIPTION
     Mulmcut applys median cut to the RGB images stored in file1,
     file2... to generate the colormapped pixel files with a .mix
     suffix. The resulting files will all have the same colormap,
     and be suitable for display with the movie (1) program.  The
     colormaps that are generated have, by default, 256  entries;
     this  may  be  modified  with the -c option.  By default the
     image data is quantized by mapping each pixel to the closest
     color  values  in  the colormap.  If the -f option is speci-
     fied, Floyd-Steinberg dithering is done before  selecting  a
     colormap entry.
