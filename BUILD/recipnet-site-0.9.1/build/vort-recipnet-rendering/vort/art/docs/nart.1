.TH NART 1 "24 July 1992" "VORT 2.2"
.SH NAME
nart - a program to distribute ray tracing.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nart 
.I file width height
.B [-n]

.B nart 
.I file_list
.B [-Zn]

.B in.netartd
.SH DESCRIPTION
In the first usage nart renders the scene defined in
.I file
across a net work by starting up art remotely using inetd.
.I file
is a file containing the scene description. 
.I width
and
.I height
are the width and height of the image in pixels.

In the second usage nart reads in a list of scene files and their
associated width and heights from the input file. The list file
should have the scene file name
and the dimensions of the output picture one per line. If the Z option
is specfied pix files are compressed as they are generated.

In both cases the
.I -n
option disables file preprocessing by art.

To set nart up the additions need to be made to /etc/inetd.conf
and /etc/services. In /etc/services add
.nf

netartd            1993/tcp                        # net art daemon

.fi
and in /etc/inetd.conf add
.nf

netartd	 stream tcp      nowait root /usr/local/etc/in.netartd   in.netartd

.fi
For instructions on the scene file see the manual page for art(1).
