.TH DART 1 "24 July 1992" "VORT 2.2"
.SH NAME
dart - a distributed ray-tracer for rendering algebraic surfaces and CSG models.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dart
.RB [ -h
.IR hostfile ]
.RB [ -n ]
.RB [ -o
.IR outfile ]
.RB [ -p
.IR path ]
.RB [ -v ]
.I file width height

.B in.artd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dart
renders the scene defined in
.I file
across a network by means of remote in.artd processes, the latter normally
started via inetd.
.I file
is a file containing the scene description. 
.I width
and
.I height
are the width and height of the image in pixels.  It is important to note
that unless the -p option is passed to
.BR dart ,
each
.B in.artd
assumes that it can access the scene file using the same absolute path name by
which dart accesses it.

To set dart up the additions need to be made to /etc/inetd.conf
and /etc/services. In /etc/services add
.nf

artd            1992/tcp                        # distributed art daemon

.fi
and in /etc/inetd.conf add
.nf

artd	 stream tcp      nowait root /usr/local/etc/in.artd   in.artd

.fi
For instructions on the scene file see the manual page for art(1).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-h \ hostname
Read the list of hosts to use from file
.IR hostname .
The default hostname file can be set at configure time, but typically is
/usr/local/lib/vort/hosts.
.TP
.B \-n
Do not preprocess the scene file.
.TP
.BI \-o \ outfile
Use
.I outfile
to name the output file.  If
.I outfile
does not already end with ".pix" then ".pix" is appended.
.TP
.BI \-p \ path
When this option is specified,
.B dart
passes
.I path
to each
.B in.artd
as the path by which to access the scene file.  This is useful when the
filesystem containing the scene file is mounted at a different point on
the
.B in.artd
systems than it is on the
.B dart
system.  When -p is not specified, the path is determined from the current
working directory and any path component (absolute or relative) of the scene
file name.
.TP
.B \-v
Turn on verbose mode.  Some status messages are sent to stderr as the program
proceeds.

.SH FILES
Each
.B in.artd
writes a log to its local /tmp/dartlog.  

.SH BUGS
All the
.B in.artd
servers must be able to access the scene file by the same absolute path name.
.RB ( dart
does not send the file, just the name and path.)
.P
The local host must have an entry in
.I /etc/services
for the TCP artd service, even if it is not offering artd services itself.
