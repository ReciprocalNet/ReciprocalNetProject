NART(1)                  USER COMMANDS                    NART(1)



NAME
     nart - a program to distribute ray tracing.

SYNOPSIS
     nart file width height [-n]

     nart file_list [-Zn]

     in.netartd

DESCRIPTION
     In the first usage nart renders the scene  defined  in  file
     across  a  net work by starting up art remotely using inetd.
     file is a file containing the scene description.  width  and
     height are the width and height of the image in pixels.

     In the second usage nart reads in a list of scene files  and
     their  associated width and heights from the input file. The
     list file should have the scene file name and the dimensions
     of  the  output  picture  one  per  line. If the Z option is
     specfied pix files are compressed as they are generated.

     In both cases the -n option disables file  preprocessing  by
     art.

     To  set  nart  up  the  additions  need  to   be   made   to
     /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services. In /etc/services add

     netartd            1993/tcp                        # net art daemon

     and in /etc/inetd.conf add

     netartd    stream tcp      nowait root /usr/local/etc/in.netartd   in.netartd

     For instructions on the scene file see the manual  page  for
     art(1).
