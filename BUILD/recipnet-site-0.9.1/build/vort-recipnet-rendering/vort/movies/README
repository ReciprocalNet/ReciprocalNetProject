This directory contains some simple programs for generating
some movie sequences. To use them you must enter each directory,
compile the C program in that directory (cc -o prog prog.c -lm),
then run the program. Each program will produce 36 ".scn" files
for art. Each directory also contains a csh script called "run"
which will run the 36 scn files in batches of 6. (run 300 300).
We suggest a resolution no bigger than 300x300, as any bigger
and the suns slow down the screen update to much. (Although
with the MIT X11R4 server it flys if you can use the X11 movie
program with the -p option)

After all the ".scn" files have been processed, you then "mulmcut"
the ".pix" files (mulmcut *.pix) which will produce corresponding
".mix" files all having the same (optimal) colormap. These files
are then ready to view using "movie" (movie prog*.mix).

Oh yeah, you'll probably have to make the file "tile.pix" and copy
it into some directories (art tile.scn 2 2). This ".scn" file should
be in the vort/art/scenes directory.
