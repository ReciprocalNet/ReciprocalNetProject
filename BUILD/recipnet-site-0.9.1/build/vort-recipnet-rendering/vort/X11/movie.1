.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Movie
displays each VORT image file on a suitable X workstation in the sequence
given on the command line. If the images are full colour they are displayed
in greyscale. Full colour 24 bit images may be median cut (see median (1))
to produce 8 bit colour mapped images. Multiple 24 bit images may have
mulmcut (1) performed on them to produce multiple 8 bit colour mapped
images all sharing the same colour map. Images that have a colour map are
displayed using the colour map of the first encountered image.
.LP
If 
.I\-t
is specified the title of each file is printed in the window as well.
.LP
If 
.I\-u
is specified each image is displayed upside down.
.LP
If 
.I\-p
is specified X Pixmaps are used instead of XImages for each frame of the
display. X Pixmaps are much faster if your X Server has enough memory
to hold all the images without to much swaping. XImages are slow, but
at least you can get your movie displayed with them.
Try both out and see what happens.
.LP
If
.I\-s
is specified an XSync is done between each frame. This helps when using
the -p option as sometimes there is some latency when a button is "pressed".
.LP
If
.I\-d secs
is specified there will be a delay of secs seconds between each frame.
The default is to show each frame as fast as possible. Secs may be less
than 1.
.LP
If
.I\-f
is specified a new colour map is created for the program. The default is
to try to use the default colour map and if this fails to create a new
colour map.
.LP
If
.I\-geom (or -g or -geometry) geometry
is specified the standard X geometry string will be used to position and
size the window. The size and position of the window may also be set in
the
.I \.Xdefaults
file. Eg 
.I vort.Geometry: =+50+50

.LP
If
.I\-display displayname
is specified an alternative X display is used.
