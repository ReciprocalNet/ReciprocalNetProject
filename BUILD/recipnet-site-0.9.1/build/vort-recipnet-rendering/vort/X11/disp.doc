NAME
     disp, - program for displaying a VORT image file.

SYNOPSIS
     disp [ -m<magnification> ] [ -u ] [ -f ] [ -geom geometry ]
     [ -display displayname ] file

DESCRIPTION
     Disp displays a VORT image files on a  suitable  X  worksta-
     tion.  If  the  image  is a 24 bit image and the Workstation
     supports 24bit displays, then the image is  shown  in  24bit
     colour. Otherwise, if the image is a 24 bit image it is con-
     verted to 256 shades of grey for display. 24 bit images  may
     be  median  cut  to produce colour mapped 8 bit images using
     median (1). If  the  file  has  a  colourmap  the  image  is
     displayed using that image file's colourmap.

     If -m is specified the magnification (an integer value  from
     one  to  five)  is applied to the image before display. (Not
     available in 24bit displays yet).

     If -f is specified a new colour map is created for the  pro-
     gram.  The  default  is to try to use the default colour map
     and if this fails  to  create  a  new  colour  map.  (8  bit
     displays only).

     If -geom (or -g or  -geometry)  geometry  is  specified  the
     standard X geometry string will be used to position and size
     the window. The size and position of the window may also  be
     set in the .Xdefaults file. Eg vort.Geometry: =+50+50



     If  -display  displayname  is  specified  an  alternative  X
     display is used.
