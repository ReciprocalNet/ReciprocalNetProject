	Text3d is supposed to generate 3-D text. It does this by using boxes
	and cylinders (or cylinders and spheres if desired) to subsitute for
	the vectors in the Hershey fonts. This program can therefore make
	very large files. This program is a real hack from the original
	Vogle text.c routine.

	NOTE: You need to also get VOGLE (available from www.wumpus.com.au/eric)
	and make the binary versions of the Hershey fonts. Text3d uses these
	binary versions of the fonts.

	There are a number of examples here as well to run them you would
	do something like the following:

	text3d ABC.in > ABC.scn
	art ABC.scn 512 512

	text3d 3d.in > 3d.scn
	art 3d.scn 512 512

	text3d hello.in > hello.scn
	art hello.scn 512 512

	text3d mary.in > mary.scn
	art mary.scn 512 512

	text3d pdsfd.in > pdsfd.scn
	art pdsfd.scn 512 512

	text3d decr.in > decr.scn
	art decr.scn 512 512
