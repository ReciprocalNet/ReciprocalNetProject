NAME
     text3d, - Generate 3D text input  files  for  the  raytracer
     art.

SYNOPSIS
     text3d infile

DESCRIPTION
     Text3d  reads  input  from  the  file  infile  containing  a
     description of the input text (font, size etc), converts the
     Hershey vector representation into either boxes capped  with
     cylinders  or  cylinders  capped with spheres and outputs to
     stdout a file suitable for input to the raytracer art.

     The input description consists of a number of directive key-
     words  with one or more arguments contained in parentheses -
     except for the copy keyword which will be described later.

     Keywords and parameters are:

     copy { ... }

     copies everything from the first '{' to  the  matching  '}'.
     Non-matching

     output(box_cyl) or output(cyl_sph)

     sets the output type to either boxes capped  with  cylinders
     (box_cyl) or cylinders capped with spheres (cyl_sph)

     ambient (red, green, blue)

     when set will output the ambient keyword with each primitive
     generated.

     colour (red, green, blue)

     when set will output the colour keyword with each  primitive
     generated.

     material (ri, kd, ks, ksexp)

     when set will output the material keyword with  each  primi-
     tive generated.

     font ("fontname")

     specifies which Hershey font to use. The  fontname  must  be
     enclosed on quotes. The fontname is any valid Hershey binary
     font file as generated by the Vogle distribution.

     textsize (xsize, ysize)

TEXT3D(1)                USER COMMANDS                  TEXT3D(1)



     Specifies the size of each character.

     textradius (size)

     Specifies the size  of  the  boxes  and  cylinders  (or  the
     cylinders and spheres) that make up the text.

     textang (angle)

     Specifies the angle (in degrees) from  the  horizontal  that
     the subsequent text strings are to be generated.

     move (x, y, z)

     Move to the absolute 3D position. This enables  text  to  be
     arbitrarily  placed  in  space. The text generated will have
     it's origin located at the last x, y, z position  specified.
     (see centertext also).

     centertext (true) or centertext (false)

     Specifies that all following text is to be centred about the
     last  specified 3D position. The default is to draw the text
     a plane parallel to the X-Y plane with the lower left corner
     of the text begining at the last specified 3D position. When
     centertext(true) is used the centre of the text string  will
     be positioned at the last 3D coordinates given.

     fixedwidth (true) or fixedwidth (false)

     Specifies that the generated text is to be drawn with  fixed
     width, even if the font is not a fixed width font. The spac-
     ing of characters in this case is given by the largest char-
     acter in the font.

     drawchar ('c')

     Draws the specified character. The character may  be  either
     an  integer representing the character of the quoted charac-
     ter itself.

     drawstr ("string")

     Draws the quoted string of characters. A  quote  (")  itself
     may be escaped with a '' character.

     rotate (angle, axis)

     when set will output the rotate keyword with each  primitive
     generated.

     scale (xscale, yscale, zscale)

TEXT3D(1)                USER COMMANDS                  TEXT3D(1)



     when set will output the scale keyword with  each  primitive
     generated.

     translate (xtrans, ytrans, ztrans)

     when set will output the translate keyword with each  primi-
     tive generated.
