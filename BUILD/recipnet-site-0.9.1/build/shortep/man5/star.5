.SH NAME
star \- star file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR STAR ,
Self-defining Text Archive and Retreival, format is a highly flexible,
user-extensible format for describing textual or numeric data in a manner that
is accessible to any text editor or viewer.
.P
.I File Structure

A
.B STAR
file is a sequence of zero or more
.B data_
and/or
.B global_
blocks.  The two differ in that data blocks are identified by unique labels
and identify disjoint sections of name space, whereas global blocks are
unlabeled and address a name space shared among all
.BR data_ " and " global_
blocks.  Each block contains ia sequence of one or more
.IR "data items" " and/or " "save frames" .
.P
.I Save frames
consist of a labelled
.B save_
header, zero or more
.I data items
and an unlabelled
.B save_
trailer.
.P
.I Data items consist of either a
.IR "data name" / "data value"
pair, or a
.B loop_
structure.  Data names begin with an underscore and may contain any legal
.B STAR
character except whitespace.  Data values may be any of the following:
.RS
A non-quoted text string containing no white space and not beginning with
a dollar sign; if at the beginning of a line then also not beginning with
a semicolon.
.RE
.RS
A single- or double-quoted string, not extending across any line break.  The
closing quote must match the opening quote.  Quotation marks of the type of
the delimiters may be included without special provision if they are not
followed by white space.  The delimiting quotes are not considered part of
the data value itself.
.RE
.RS
A semicolon delimited block of text, where each of the semicolon delimiters
is at the beginning of its line.
.RE
.RS
A frame code, which consists of a dollar sign followed by the label of an
in-scope save frame.
.RE
.P
Loops consist of a header followed by a list of data values, possibly
interspersed with
.B stop_
keywords to delimit the ends of the value lists associated with nested loops.
Loop headers consist of a
.B loop_
keyword followed by one or more data names and/or nested loop headers.  Nested
loop headers differ from normal loop headers only in that they are terminated
by
.B stop_ keywords if their ends do not coincide with the ends of all loop
headers containing them.
.P
Comments may be inserted into a
.B STAR
file by inserting them after a leading hash mark (#).  The hash mark and all
characters following up to the end of the line are ignored when the file is
processed, unless they occur within the context of a quoted string or semicolon delimited data value.
.P
.B STAR
.I Characters

The following characters are considered whitespace in a
.B STAR
file:
.I horizontal tab
(ASCII 09),
.I line feed
(ASCII 10),
.I vertical tab
(ASCII 11),
.I form feed
(ASCII 12),
.I carriage return
(ASCII 13), and
.I space
(ASCII 32).  Of the whitespace characters, only two,
.I horizontal tab
and
.I space
are permitted inside quoted or semicolon-delimited data values.  Characters
with ASCII codes from 32 to 126 will normally make up the bulk of the file.
Characters other than those already specified are not permitted.  (All ASCII
code numbers given in decimal.)
Line termination is significant in
.B STAR
files where semicolon-delimited data values and comments are involved.  In those
cases, the appropriate line-termination sequence for the current context is
assumed
.RI ( i.e.
<CR><LF> on DOS/Windows, <LF> on UNIX).

.SH BUGS
There are portability problems inherent in the context-sensitive line
termination aspect of the specification, particularly where semicolon-delimited
data values are concerned.  For instance, a
.B STAR
file prepared on a Windows machine will normally have lines terminated by
<CR><LF> sequences.  If that file is read on a Macintosh without converting
to the Mac's line termination (just <CR>) then no semicolon in the entire
file will be recognized as occuring at the beginning of the line.
.P
By design,
.B STAR
is not a suitable format for archive or transmission of binary data.
