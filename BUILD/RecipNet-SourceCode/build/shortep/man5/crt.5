.SH NAME
crt \- crt file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B CRT
file format is designed to be a compact representation of a crystallographic
model, with emphasis on features facilitating fast transmission and
visualization.  In particular, the name
.B CRT
comes from the fact that atomic coordinates on the file are referenced to
a Cartesian system of axes with units of Angstroms.
.B CRT
files consist of free-format lines, with information content varying depending
on section of the file, as determined by section-delimiting keywords.
.P
.B CRT
files begin with a line containing the keyword "CARTESIAN", integer counts of
the numbers of atoms and bonds listed on the file, and a file label.
Next comes one or more atom lines, each containing an atom label, three
coordinates, and the atomic number.
.P
The end of the atom list and beginning of the bond list is designated by the
"ENDATOMS" keyword.  Lines in the bond list consist of pairs of integers,
designating pairs of atoms from the atom list between which there is a bond.
Although it is technically legal to list the numbers in either order, avoiding
duplication is facilitated by giving the lower number first.  The end of the
bond list is designated by "ENDBONDS" keyword.
.P
The remaining sections are optional.
.P
The unit cell section is designated by the "CELL" keyword.  It always contains
four lines: the Cartesian coordinates of the crystallographic
.IR a ", " b ", and " c
vectors and of the crystallographic origin.
It is a felicitous side effect that the first three of these four lines
form a transformation matrix and the last line a translation vector so that
left-multiplying a column vector of crystallographic coordinates by the matrix
and adding the translation vector to the result transforms the crystallographic
coordinates into the Cartesian system.
.P
The symmetry section is designated by the "SYMMETRY" keyword and on the same
line an integer count of the number of symmetry operations in the section.  The
identity operation is always assumed and should not be specified or counted.
Other symmetry operations are given in the form of a rotation matrix and
translation;
left multiplication of a column vector of Cartesian coordinates followed by
addition of the translation vector produces a crystallographically equivalent
position in the same system of Cartesian coordinates.  This section terminates
with an "ENDSYMM" keyword.
.SH BUGS
There is currently no way to indicate bond order.
.P
There is no facility for indicating bonds to symmetry equivalents of the atoms
in the list; only to the exact positions listed.
