.SH NAME
sdt \- sdt file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR SDT ,
Standard Data Tape, is a file format used principally with the
.SM XTEL
crystallogrphic library developed and maintained by the Indiana University
Molecular Structure Center.  It contains the model paramters and some of the
refinement parameters of a crystallographic model.
.P
The
.B SDT
format is record oriented, with each record consisting of one line.  The
layouts of the various records are specified in terms of the Fortran formatting
codes used to read and/or write them.  With that said, an
.B SDT
consists of the following records, in order:
.P
Record 1:	Title; A80
.RS
May contain arbitrary text, but certain
.SM XTEL
programs will not work correctly if the first three characters are not "MSC".
.RE
.P
Record 2:	Cell Parameters; 7F10.5
.RS
The axial lengths in Angstroms, cosines of the interaxial angles, and wavelength
of the x-rays used in the experiment.
.RE
.P
Record 3:	Cell Parameter Uncertainties; 7F10.5
.RS
The standard uncertainties in the six cell parameters, followed by the unit cell
volume in cubic Angstroms.  For many
.SM XTEL
programs the volume can be omitted.
.RE
.P
Record 4:	Space group Symbol; A16
.RS
The Hermann-Maugin symbol for the space group, formatted according to these
conventions: the centering symbol and the operators for each axis are separated
by spaces, but no other spaces are used; all letters are capital; rotoinversion
axes may be specified by preceding the rotational order with a minus sign or
by following it with "BAR", but the latter is preferred; screw axes are
designated with the two relevant digits, e.g. 21, 32, or 61; rhombohedral
space groups on rhombohedral axes are specified by an "R" as the last operator.
.RE
.P
Record 5:	Control Integers; 20I4
.RS
Various numeric flags, of which only the first seven are relevant any longer:
.RE
.RS
(1) NF, the number of scattering factors listed on the file
.RE
.RS
(2) NS, the number of symmetry operations on the file
.RE
.RS
(3) INC, zero for a centrosymmetric group, one otherwise
.RE
.RS
(4) IL, an integer code designating the Laue class
.RE
.RS
(5) Z, the number of formula units in each unit cell
.RE
.RS
(6) IB, the background count per measurement, in seconds
.RE
.RS
(7) IF, the "ignorance factor"
.RE
.P
Records 6 and 7:	Scattering Factors
.RS
One pair of records 6 and 7 for each of the NF scattering factor types.
.RE
.P
Record 8:	Empirical Formula; 16I4
.RS
Pairs of atomic number and number or atoms.  Atomic numbers should not be
duplicated.  There should be NF pairs; if NF is larger than 8 then additional
empirical formula records may be added.
.RE
.P
Records 9 and 10:	LASL symmetry codes; each 7I10
.RS
Symmetry operations encoded into integers in the manner devised by Alan Larson
for his LASL package of crystallographic software.
.RE
.P
Record 11:	Symmetry cards; 3(F15.9,3I3)
.RS
Symmetry cards in Oak Ridge format.  One card for each of the NS symmetry
operations.
.RE
.P
Record 12:	Atomic Parameters; A8,I2,3I3,5I1,6X,4F10.5,A8
.RS
.RE
Record 13:	Thermal Paramteres; 6F10.6
.RS
One pair for each atom in the model.  The fields in record 12 are, in order:
.IP \(bu
Atom label.
.IP \(bu
ISENT -- a sentinel to mark the end of the atoms list; always blank for atoms.
.IP \(bu
Primary scattering factor.  The number number of the scattering factor to use
in the list of scattering factors above.
.IP \(bu
Secondary scattering factor.  A secondary scattering factor to use in the
case of a disorder or partial occupancy on this site.  Normally 0, which covers
the fully ordered and partial occupancy cases.
.IP \(bu
Anisotropic flag.  1 if the the thermal parameters are anisotropic, 0 otherwise.
.IP \(bu
Occupancy refinement flag.  1 to refine the occupancy, zero otherwise.
.IP \(bu
Fix X flag.  1 to fix the x coordinate, zero otherwise.
.IP \(bu
Fix Y flag.  1 to fix the y coordinate, zero otherwise.
.IP \(bu
Fix Z flag.  1 to fix the z coordinate, zero otherwise.
.IP \(bu
Fix thermal parameters flag.  1 to fix the thermal parameter(s), zero otherwise.
.IP \(bu
Occupancy.  This is the fraction of the secondary scattering factor to use, so
the value should be zero for full occupancy / no disorder.
.IP \(bu
x coordinate
.IP \(bu
y coordinate
.IP \(bu
z coordinate
.IP \(bu
Information field.  Content varies.
.P
Record 13 contains either a single isotropic B value in field one, or the six
anisotropic beta values in the order 11, 22, 33, 12, 13, 23.
.RE
.P
Record 14:	Sentinal record; I10
.RS
Contains a 1 in column 10 to indicate the end of the atom list.
.RE
.P
Record 15:	Scale factor; F10.5
.RS
The scale factor for Fs.
.RE
.P
Record 16:	Extinction factor; E10.2 (optional)
.RS
The extinction parameter applicable to Larson's extinction formula.
.RE
.SH NOTES
The occupancy factor is a true occupancy, unlike a similar parameter 
incorporating the site multiplicity as well that is used with some other
crystallographic software.
.SH BUGS
The format does not support fractional atom counts in the empirical formula.
.P
The file format is somewhat inefficient, as there is a not insubstantial amount
of duplication of information.
