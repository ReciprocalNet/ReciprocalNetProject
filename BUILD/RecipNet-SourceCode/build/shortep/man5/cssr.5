cssr \- cssr file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR CSSR ,
Crystal Structure Search and Retrieval,
file format is a format designed by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre
for use with the Cambridge Structural Database.  It is understood by a
wide variety of crystallographic software, and as such provides a suitable
means of data interchange in some circumstances.  In terms of fortan formatting
codes, here is the specification:
.TP
Record 1
Cell dimensions; 38X, 3F8.3.  The lengths of the three crystallographic axes.
.TP
Record 2
Cell angles and Space Group; 21X,3F8.3,4X,'SPGR=',I3,1X,A11.  The unit cell
angles, space group number, and space group symbol.
.TP
Record 3
Model parameters; 2I4,1X,A60.  The number of atoms, coordinate system flag,
and first title.  The coordinate system flag is zero for fractional coordinates
or 1 for Cartesian coordinates.
.TP
Record 4
Title 2; A53.
.TP
Record 5
Atomic parameters; I4,1X,A4,2X,3(F9.5,1X),8I4,1X,F7.3.  (one per atom)  The
serial number of the atom, atom name, coordinates, bonding connectivities, and
atomic charge.
.SH BUGS
Does not include thermal parameters.
