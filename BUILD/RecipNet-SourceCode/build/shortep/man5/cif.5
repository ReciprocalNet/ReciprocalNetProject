.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR CIF ,
Crystallographic Information File, is a highly flexible, user-extensible format
for describing crystallographic experiments, models, and manuscripts.  It is a
restricted dialect of Self-defining Text ARchive (
.BR star (5))
format.  The specific restrictions are:
.RS
(1) Lines are restricted to a maximum of 80 characters in length.
.RE
.RS
(2) No 
.BR global_ " blocks or " save_
frames.
.RE
.RS
(3) No nested
.BR loops .
.RE
.RS
(4) All data names and block codes are case insensitive.
.RE
The version 1
.B CIF
specification also required
.RS
(5) Data names and data block codes may be no longer than 32 characters.
.RE
(That restriction was lifted in
.B CIF
version 2.)
.P
Furthermore, there are several conventions in the light of which
.BR CIF s
are normally interpreted:
.RS
(1)
.B CIF
data names are normally chosen from among those in the
.BR "CIF dictionary" ,
and should be used in a manner consistent with the definitions therein.
.RE
.RS
(2)
.B CIF
data values are typed; moreover, their types are determined implicitly,
according to the following rules:
.RS
A single period character by itself is a value of the special type "null".
.RE
.RS
A single question mark by itself is  a value of the special type "unknown".
.RE
.RS
A data value that begins with a decimal digit, a plus or minus sign, or a
period, and is not enclosed by matching single or double quotes, is of type
number.
.RE
.RS
A data value that extends over more than one line (see the
.BR star (5)
syntax definition) is of type text.
.RE
.RS
A data value is of type character if its type is not otherwise determined by
these rules.
.RE
.RE
.RS
(4) Data values of types character and text are semantically interchangeable.
.RE
.RS
(5) Numeric data values may be expressed in integer, floating point, or
scientific notation formats.  When a number is followed immediately (without
whitespace) by an integer in parentheses, that integer is interpreted as the
standard uncertainty in the final digit(s) of the number.
.RE
.RS
(6) The
.B CIF dictionary
specifies the units in which numeric type data values are to be expressed for
the data names contained therein.
.RE
.P
.B CIF
is supported by the Internation Union for Crystallography, and has quickly
been adopted as an international standard.  Many scientific journals that
publish crystal structures accept or even require that appropriate
.BR CIF s
accompany submissions with crystallographic content.  At least one journal
.RI ( "Acta Crystallographica, Section C" )
requests that all submissions be entirely in
.B CIF
format, except for figures.
.SH BUGS
There are portability problems inherent in the 80-character line limit, and
.BR CIF s
support (inherited from
.BR STAR (5))
for multiple line-termination sequences.  For instance, if a line consists of
80 significant characters followed by a <CR><LF> line termination sequence,
then it is legal on DOS/Windows, but illegal on UNIX.
.P
For other issues consult the
.BR STAR (5)
manpage.
