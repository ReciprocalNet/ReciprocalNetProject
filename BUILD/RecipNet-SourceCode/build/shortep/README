Welcome to SHORTEP!

Shortep is a tool for reading, examining, manipulating, and writing
crystallographic models.  The original version was created by John C. Huffman
in 1985 by stripping all the graphics generation features from Carroll
Johnson's ORTEP II and adding a console interface and certain file manipulation
routines.  The name comes from the program's genesis: it is a SHortened ORTEP.
The program has been maintained by John C. Bollinger (jobollin@indiana.edu)
since 1996.


Features

Shortep reads crystallographic models in one of two formats: SDT (developed in
and mainly used by the Indiana University Molecular Structure Center) and CIF
(crystallographic information file, an international standard backed by the
Internation Union for Crystallography).  It provides for measurement of
interatomic distances and angles, construction of new models, renumbering of
atoms, and saving the model in SDT, CSSR (an old Cambridge Database output
format supported by several software packages), or CRT (a Cartesian coordinate
format developed by the IUMSC for the Reciprocal Net project) format.


Installation

1) Unpack the archive.  On systems with GNU tar, tar xzf shortep.tgz will do
   it.

2) Check the Makefile.  You can select a different installation directory if
   you like, and you may need to change the Fortran compiler and/or compiler
   flags.

3) make

4) If all is well,
   make install

   Otherwise, troubleshoot and/or send e-mail.  If you troubleshoot a problem
   yourself, then I would love to hear about both the problem and the
   resolution.

5) Optionally,
   make clean

   or even
   make clobber

   to clean up the source directory.


Running Shortep

Normally, just
	shortep <filename>
where <filename> is the name of the input file.  Alternatively, shortep will
prompt for a file name to open if one is not supplied on the command line.
Shortep is a console-mode, command-driven program.  Because of its origin in
ORTEP, shortep commands are numeric codes.  For user convenience, however,
Shortep recognizes mnemonic keywords for most of the common commands.  There
is on-line help available, so if you get stuck try the "help" command.  If all
else fails, you could always consider reading the manual page, which should
have been installed along with the executable when you did a "make install".


Technical Information

Shortep is written in Fortran 77 with a few extensions.  Most of the extensions
are standard in Fortran 90 and later, the only exceptions of which I am
aware being (1) use of the nonstandard iargc and getarg routines to process
command-line arguments, and (2) use of the nonstandard $ format specifier to
mean the equivalent of F90's advance="no" read argument.  Other extensions
include the CYCLE and EXIT statements and DO WHILE loops.  The source has been
tested successfully with GNU g77, which is freely available on a wide range
of platforms, so if you can't compile with your system's normal compiler then
try installing g77.
