SAAJ is available as part of JWSDP.  </ul>  <li> The messaging provider supports the mandatory parts of the EBXML specification    as a profile. The local provider generates and consumes plain SOAP messages.</li>  <li> The release implements the HTTP/SOAP binding.</li>  <li> Creating a <tt>ProviderConnection</tt> object from the <tt>ProviderConnectionFactory</tt>   object does not initialize the per-client state on the provider. The current    behavior is that the per-client state is initialized on the first client-initiated    interaction, that is, when the methods <tt>send</tt> or <tt>getMetaData</tt>   are called, as opposed to when a <tt>ProviderConnection</tt> object is created.   This delayed initialization is a bug that affects pure receiver servlets.   The workaround is to invoke the <tt>ProviderConnection.getMetaData</tt> method   in the Servlet's <tt>init</tt> method.</li>  <li>  The JAXM provider and the Provider Administration webapps run at port   8080 by default.   </li>  <li> When delivery of a message fails, the provider tries to resend it.    The number of retries is determined by the retry limit configured for the     provider, with the default maximum being 100. When Tomcat is restarted, the    provider will first try to deliver the persistent messages used in the previous    Tomcat run. This may cause a message or exception similar to "Provider.MessageProcessor    Retrying because .... " to appear until the maximum number of retries has    been reached. If this problem persists, try deleting the directory where    persistent messages are stored ("ebxml" for the remote sample). You may also    want to reconfigure the provider so that it has a lower retry limit.  </li>   <li>   Please refer to the Java Web Services Pack tutorial for details on SAAJ and other    relevant technologies.   </li></ul></body></html>
