<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__Help">-Help</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Print this help message and exit.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__Version">-Version</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Print version information and exit

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__language">-language [EXT=]LANG</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Assume that any file with a suffix of ``<EM>EXT</EM>'' is a <CODE>LANG</CODE> source file (note that you must supply any leading '.'). If the ``<EM>EXT</EM>'' begins with a slash ('/'), then the name that follows it is considered
to be the name of an interpreter that is invoked using ``#!<EM>path</EM>/<EM>EXT</EM>`` as the first line of the script (and if the language can't be determined
from the extension, then the first line of the file will be used). If ''<EM>EXT</EM>=`` is omitted then <CODE>LANG</CODE> will be the default language for any files whose language cannot be
determined.  <CODE>LANG</CODE> must be one of the following:

<DL>
<DT><DD>
<P>
Ada, Assembly, Awk, C, C++, Eiffel, Java, Lisp, Pascal, Perl, Tcl, shell,
make

</DL>
<P>
Language names may <EM>not</EM> be abbreviated. This option may be specified multiple times.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__delim_ignore">-delim-ignore</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Ignore all statement delimiters. This means that lines containing nothing
but statement delimiters/terminators are *not* considered lines of code.
For C/C++ this would have the effect of ignoring lines containing nothing
but ';', '{', and '}'.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__diff">-diff</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Treat the input as output from <STRONG>diff(1)</STRONG> and report counts for both inserted and deleted source. Note that the <STRONG>-diff</STRONG> option is implied by any of <STRONG>-pred</STRONG>, <STRONG>-fromversion</STRONG> or <STRONG>-toversion</STRONG>. If the <STRONG>-diff</STRONG>
option is explicitly specified and none of these other three options are,
then the input is assumed to already be in 'diff' format (that means
regular diff format or context-diff only; ed-script format and uni-diff
output will <EM>not</EM> be understood!)

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__ignore">-ignore</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Don't bother with files whose language can't be determined.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__filelist">-filelist</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Assume that the source files to read are listed in the contents of the
files given on the command line (filelist is read from standard input if no
files are given). This is useful if you wish to use the output of commands
Like <STRONG>find(1)</STRONG> as input to this command.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__name">-name REGEXP</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Only look at files whose filename (not including the directory path)
completely match the given perl-style regular expression. Does not apply to
directories when <STRONG>-recurse</STRONG> is used. May be specified multiple times (for a description of Perl's
regular expression syntax, invoke <CODE>man perlre</CODE> or <CODE>perldoc perlre</CODE>).

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__except">-except REGEXP</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Don't look at files whose filename (not including the directory path)
completely match the given perl-style regular expression (even if it would
be matched by a <STRONG>-name</STRONG> expression). Does not apply to directories when <STRONG>-recurse</STRONG> is used. May be specified multiple times (for a description of Perl's
regular expression syntax, invoke <CODE>man perlre</CODE> or <CODE>perldoc perlre</CODE>).

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__prefix">-prefix REGEXP</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Ignore/strip the leading portion of each line that matches the given
perl-style regular expression. Do <EM>not</EM> use a leading '^' unless you mean to match the caret character itself (for
a description of Perl's regular expression syntax, invoke <CODE>man perlre</CODE> or <CODE>perldoc perlre</CODE>)

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__recurse">-recurse</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
For every ``source'' file that is actually a directory, read all source
files in the directory.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__fromversion">-fromversion SELECTOR</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
When used with <STRONG>-diff</STRONG>, assumes that <EM>SELECTOR</EM> is a valid ClearCase version selector and uses it in conjunction with <STRONG><A HREF=cdiff.html>cdiff</A></STRONG> as the ``from'' version of each file specified. Only one of <CODE>-fromversion</CODE>
and <CODE>-pred</CODE> may be specified!

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__toversion">-toversion SELECTOR</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
When used with <STRONG>-diff</STRONG>, assumes that <EM>SELECTOR</EM> is a valid ClearCase version selector and uses it in conjunction with <STRONG><A HREF=cdiff.html>cdiff</A></STRONG> as the ``to'' version of each file specified.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__pred">-pred</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
When used with <STRONG>-diff</STRONG>, assumes that each file is an element in a ClearCase VOB and uses it in
conjunction with <STRONG><A HREF=cdiff.html>cdiff</A></STRONG> as the ``from'' version of each file specified (note that the predecessor
version is chosen relative to the ``to'' version of the file). Only one of
<STRONG>-pred</STRONG> and <STRONG>-fromversion</STRONG> may be specified!

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__separate">-separate REGEXP</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Assume that whenever a source line is encountered that completely matches
the given perl-style regular expression, it indicates the end of the
current source context. Useful if you are trying to count lines from the
output of a command like <STRONG>diff(1)</STRONG> and you dont want a comment or quote in one changed section to be treated
as if it continued into the next block of modifications. May be specified
multiple times (for a description of Perl's regular expression syntax,
invoke <CODE>man perlre</CODE> or <CODE>perldoc perlre</CODE>).

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__counts">-counts SPEC</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Specify which counts/columns to display in the output. <EM>SPEC</EM>
may contain any of the following (separated by '+'):

<P>
<PRE>   &quot;Lines&quot; : print the total # of lines
   &quot;Blank&quot; : print the total # of blank-lines
   &quot;Cmnts&quot; : print the total # of comments
   &quot;NCSL&quot;  : print the total # of non-comment source lines
   &quot;AESL&quot;  : print the total # of assembly-equivalent source lines
</PRE>
<P>
The above keywords may be abbreviated to a unique prefix if desired. If the <STRONG>-counts</STRONG> option is <EM>not</EM> specified, then
<CODE>Lines+Blank+Cmnts+NCSL+AESL</CODE> is implied.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__sections">-sections SPEC</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Specify the sections in the output. <EM>SPEC</EM> may contain any of the following (separated by '+'):

<P>
<PRE>   &quot;Header&quot;     : the column labels and separator bar
   &quot;Files&quot;      : the counts for each input file
   &quot;LangTotals&quot; : the totals for each language encountered.
   &quot;Totals&quot;     : the totals for all files.
</PRE>
<P>
The above keywords may be abbreviated to a unique prefix if desired. If the <STRONG>-sections</STRONG> option is <EM>NOT</EM> specified, then <CODE>Header+Files+LangTotals+Totals</CODE> is implied.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__vcstring">-vcstring STRING</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Specify that <EM>STRING</EM> is the delimiter used by your version control system and that the file
suffix should be determined by only considering the portion of the file
path that precedes the first occurrence of <EM>STRING</EM>.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__output">-output FILE</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Redirect output to the named file (should have the same effect as
redirecting STDOUT on the cmdline using ``&gt; <EM>FILE</EM>'').

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_FILE">FILE</A></STRONG><DD>
<P>
Name of an input file.

</DL>
<P>
Option names are case insensitive and only a unique prefix is required.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>
<STRONG>sclc</STRONG> will count the number of lines, blank-lines, comments, non-comment source
lines (NCSL), and assembly equivalent source lines (AESL) in the given
input files (which are assumed to be free of syntax errors). The output
format will look something like the following:

<P>
<PRE>  &lt;header with column titles and separator line&gt;
  &lt;count1&gt; &lt;count2&gt; ... &lt;filename&gt;  (&lt;language&gt;)
    ...      ...           ...         ...
  &lt;total1&gt; &lt;total2&gt; ... ----- &lt;language&gt; -----  (# files)
    ...      ...           ...         ...
  &lt;total1&gt; &lt;total2&gt; ... ***** TOTAL *****  (# files)
</PRE>
<P>
If the <STRONG>-diff</STRONG> option is given than two lines are printed for each set of counts: one for
deleted lines and one for inserted lines (and the <CODE>DELETED</CODE>
or <CODE>INSERTED</CODE> keyword will appear on each output-line). If <STRONG>-pred</STRONG> or
<STRONG>-fromversion</STRONG> or <STRONG>-toversion</STRONG> is given then <STRONG>-diff</STRONG> is implied and <STRONG><A HREF=cdiff.html>cdiff</A></STRONG>
command is invoked with the <STRONG>-blank_ignore</STRONG> option to compare file versions.

<P>
The <STRONG>-counts</STRONG> and <STRONG>-sections</STRONG> options may be used to control which counts and/or sections to print. The
counts are always printed in an order such that:

<P>
<PRE>     lines --&gt; blank-lines --&gt; comments --&gt; NCSL --&gt; AESL
</PRE>
<P>
where ``X --&gt; Y'' means that the count of Xs always precedes the count
of Ys.

<P>

<P>
The typical use for <STRONG>sclc</STRONG> would be to just give it the filenames on the command line:

<P>
<PRE>  $ sclc dir.c dir.h
  Lines  Blank  Cmnts   NCSL     AESL     
  =====  =====  =====  =====  ==========  =============================
    215     26     14    158       395.0  dir.c  (C)
     41      8     16     24        60.0  dir.h  (C)
    256     34     30    182       455.0  ----- C -----  (2 files)
</PRE>
<P>
There are options to control which columns you do/dont want to see. The <CODE>NCSL</CODE> column is for ``non-comment source lines''. The <CODE>AESL</CODE> column is for ``assembly equivalent source lines'' (it calculates this
using assembly-equivalence factors published by Software Productivity
Research). If all you care about is NCSL, you could simply invoke it as:

<P>
<PRE>  $ sclc -counts ncsl dir.[ch]
   NCSL  
  =====  ==============================================================
    158  dir.c  (C)
     24  dir.h  (C)
    182  ----- C -----  (2 files)
</PRE>
<P>
If you dont want the header columns, and want to see the overall totals
instead of the totals per programming language (<STRONG>sclc</STRONG> can handle C, C++, Java, Perl, Assembly, Pascal, and several other
languages) then you could simply say:

<P>
<PRE>  $ sclc -counts ncsl -sections file+totals *.[ch]
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>    158  dir.c  (C)
     24  dir.h  (C)
    182  ***** TOTAL *****  (2 files)
</PRE>
<P>
If you want to know the number of lines of code that have changed between
versions of files, you can use the <STRONG>-pred</STRONG> option, or a combination of the <STRONG>-fromversion</STRONG> and <STRONG>-toversion</STRONG> options. If you simply want to know the number of new and changed lines of
code between a set of files and their immediate predecessors, use the <STRONG>-pred</STRONG>
option:

<P>
<PRE>  $ sclc -pred *.[ch]
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>  Lines  Blank  Cmnts   NCSL     AESL     
  =====  =====  =====  =====  ==========  ===============================
      3      1      0      2         5.0  dir.c DELETED  (C)
      5      1      0      4        10.0  dir.c INSERTED  (C)
      1      0      0      1         2.5  dir.h DELETED  (C)
      2      0      0      2         5.0  dir.h INSERTED  (C)
      4      1      0      3         7.5  ----- C DELETED -----  (2 files)
      7      1      0      6        15.0  ----- C INSERTED -----  (2 files)
</PRE>
<P>
Again, if you want to limit the output to include only the NCSL counts for
the individual files and their totals, add the <STRONG>-counts</STRONG> and <STRONG>-sections</STRONG>
options into the fold:

<P>
<PRE>  $ sclc -pred -counts ncsl -sections file+totals *.[ch]
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>      2  dir.c DELETED  (C)
      4  dir.c INSERTED  (C)
      1  dir.h DELETED  (C)
      2  dir.h INSERTED  (C)
      3  ***** TOTAL DELETED *****  (2 files)
      6  ***** TOTAL INSERTED *****  (2 files)
</PRE>
<P>
If you want to count the difference in source lines between specific
versions (not just the predecessor) you may use the <STRONG>-fromversion</STRONG>
option to specify the base (``from'') version to use for all comparisons.
If the base version is not explicitly specified, it defaults to whatever
version is selected in the users view. Similarly, the <STRONG>-toversion</STRONG>
option may be used to specify the target (``to'') version to use for all
comparisons. If the target version is not specified, then (like the base
version) it defaults to whatever version is selected in the users view.

<P>
So if I want to count the changed lines of code between what is in my view
and what was on the <CODE>REL1.0.0</CODE> label, I would do the following:

<P>
<PRE>  $ sclc -fromver REL1.0.0 *.[ch]
</PRE>
<P>
And if I wanted to count the changed lines of code between files on my <CODE>/main/rel1/mychanges</CODE> branch and the REL1.0.0 baseline label they where branched off from, I
would use:

<P>
<PRE>  $ sclc -fromver REL1.0.0 -tover .../mychanges/LATEST *.[ch]
</PRE>
<P>
If I wanted to see the difference in lines of code for files on to
different labels I would do something like:

<P>
<PRE>  $ sclc -fromver REL1.0.0 -tover REL2.0.0 *.[ch]
</PRE>
<P>
If I wanted to do the same as the above, but my view was already selecting
everything in the REL1.0.0 baseline, then I could simply do:

<P>
<PRE>  $ sclc -tover REL2.0.0 *.[ch]
</PRE>
<P>
Hopefully, this ``tutorial'' should have provided you with a good set of
cookbook examples for using <STRONG>sclc</STRONG>. if you ever want to see this manual page, you need only invoke <STRONG>sclc</STRONG> using the <STRONG>-help</STRONG> option:
