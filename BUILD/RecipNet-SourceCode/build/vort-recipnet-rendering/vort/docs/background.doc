BACKGROUND(1)            USER COMMANDS              BACKGROUND(1)



NAME
     background - replace the background in a file.

SYNOPSIS
     background r g b file1 file2

     background tile file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
     Background can be used to replace the background  colour  in
     the  file file1 with either another colour or a tile to pro-
     duce file2. In both cases the file file1 must have an  alpha
     channel  present  for the background command to produce any-
     thing.

     In the first usage the background  colour  in  the  file  is
     replaced  by  the  colour  given by the red, green, and blue
     values given by r, g, and b. It is assumed these values  are
     between 0 and 1.

     In the second instance the areas of background  colour  will
     be replaced by the corresponding pixel in the file tile. The
     file tile is assumed to be the same size as the  file  file1
     and  if  no  coverage  information is present in tile then a
     value of 1.0 is assumed (total coverage) in the final image.
     If  tile  does  have  coverage  information  in  it then the
     resulting image  inherits  the  information  from  tile  and
     further background colour changes can be made to file2.
