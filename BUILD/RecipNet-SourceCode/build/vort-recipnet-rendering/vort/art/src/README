By the by, for people who are interested, there are an excellent series
of papers on ray tracing and computer graphics in general published in
the NATO ASI Series of books. The volume in question is in Vol. 40,
series F, and is titled "Theoretical Foundations of Computer Graphics and
CAD". It was published in 1988 Springer-Verlag. Roman Kuchkuda's paper
in it "An Introduction To Ray Tracing", would be the best introductory paper
we have seen to date. Apart from that it was the first paper we found that
actually said what a superquadric was! (For the curious look at Barr's
paper in CG & A Jan 1981, and Franklin and Barr in CG & A July 1981).

Try the local Uni/Tech College library, it's well worth looking at.
