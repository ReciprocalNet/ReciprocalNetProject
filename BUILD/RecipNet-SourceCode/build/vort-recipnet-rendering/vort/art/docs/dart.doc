NAME
     dart - a distributed ray-tracer for rendering algebraic sur-
     faces and CSG models.

SYNOPSIS
     dart file width height [-n]

     in.artd

DESCRIPTION
     Dart renders the scene defined in file across a net work  by
     starting  up processes using inetd.  file is a file contain-
     ing the scene description. width and height  are  the  width
     and  height  of  the image in pixels. The -n option disables
     file preprocessing.

     To  set  dart  up  the  additions  need  to   be   made   to
     /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services. In /etc/services add

     artd            1992/tcp                        # distributed art daemon

     and in /etc/inetd.conf add

     artd  stream tcp      nowait root /usr/local/etc/in.artd   in.artd

     For instructions on the scene file see the manual  page  for
     art(1).
