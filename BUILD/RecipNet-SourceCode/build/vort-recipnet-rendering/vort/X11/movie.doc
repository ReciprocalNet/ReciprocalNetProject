NAME
     movie - a programme for displaying several VORT image  files
     in sequence.

SYNOPSIS
     movie [ -t ] [ -u ] [ -p ] [ -s ] [ -d secs ] [ -f ]
     [ -geom geometry ] [ -display displayname ] file1 file2 file3 ....

DESCRIPTION
     Movie displays each VORT image file on a suitable X worksta-
     tion  in  the  sequence  given  on  the command line. If the
     images are full colour they are displayed in greyscale. Full
     colour  24  bit images may be median cut (see median (1)) to
     produce 8 bit colour mapped images. Multiple 24  bit  images
     may have mulmcut (1) performed on them to produce multiple 8
     bit colour mapped images all sharing the  same  colour  map.
     Images that have a colour map are displayed using the colour
     map of the first encountered image.

     If -t is specified the title of each file is printed in  the
     window as well.

     If -u is specified each image is displayed upside down.

     If -p is specified X Pixmaps are used instead of XImages for
     each frame of the display. X Pixmaps are much faster if your
     X Server has enough memory to hold all the images without to
     much  swaping.  XImages  are  slow, but at least you can get
     your movie displayed with them.  Try both out and  see  what
     happens.

     If -s is specified an XSync is done between each frame. This
     helps  when  using  the -p option as sometimes there is some
     latency when a button is "pressed".

     If -d secs is specified  there  will  be  a  delay  of  secs
     seconds  between  each  frame.   The default is to show each
     frame as fast as possible. Secs may be less than 1.

     If -f is specified a new colour map is created for the  pro-
     gram.  The  default  is to try to use the default colour map
     and if this fails to create a new colour map.

     If -geom (or -g or  -geometry)  geometry  is  specified  the
     standard X geometry string will be used to position and size
     the window. The size and position of the window may also  be
     set in the .Xdefaults file. Eg vort.Geometry: =+50+50


     If  -display  displayname  is  specified  an  alternative  X
     display is used.
