.TH TEXT3D 1 "Feb 11, 1991" "VORT 2.0"
.SH NAME
text3d, \- Generate 3D text input files for the raytracer art.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PU
.ll +8
.B text3d
.I "infile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Text3d
reads input from the file
.I infile
containing a description of the input text (font, size etc),
converts the Hershey vector representation into either boxes
capped with cylinders or cylinders capped with spheres and
outputs to stdout a file suitable for input to the raytracer art.
.LP
The input description consists of a number of directive keywords
with one or more arguments contained in parentheses - except for
the 
.I copy 
keyword which will be described later. 
.LP
.I Keywords and parameters are:
.LP
.I copy 
{ ... }
.LP
copies everything from the first '{' to the matching '}'. Non-matching
'}' s may be escaped with a '\' character.

.I output(box_cyl)
or
.I output(cyl_sph)
.LP
sets the output type to either boxes capped with cylinders (box_cyl)
or cylinders capped with spheres (cyl_sph)

.I ambient
(red, green, blue)
.LP
when set will output the ambient keyword with each primitive generated.

.I colour
(red, green, blue)
.LP
when set will output the colour keyword with each primitive generated.

.I material
(ri, kd, ks, ksexp)
.LP
when set will output the material keyword with each primitive generated.

.I font
("fontname")
.LP
specifies which Hershey font to use. The fontname must be enclosed on 
quotes. The fontname is any valid Hershey binary font file as generated by
the Vogle distribution. 

.I textsize
(xsize, ysize)
.LP
Specifies the size of each character.

.I textradius
(size)
.LP
Specifies the size of the boxes and cylinders (or the cylinders and spheres)
that make up the text.

.I textang
(angle)
.LP
Specifies the angle (in degrees) from the horizontal that the subsequent
text strings are to be generated.

.I move
(x, y, z)
.LP
Move to the absolute 3D position. This enables text to be arbitrarily
placed in space. The text generated will have it's origin located at the
last x, y, z position specified. (see centertext also).

.I centertext
(true) 
or 
.I centertext
(false)
.LP
Specifies that all following text is to be centred about the last specified
3D position. The default is to draw the text a plane parallel to the X-Y 
plane with the lower left corner of the text begining at the last specified 
3D position. When centertext(true) is used the centre of the text string will
be positioned at the last 3D coordinates given.

.I fixedwidth
(true) or 
.I fixedwidth
(false)
.LP
Specifies that the generated text is to be drawn with fixed width, even
if the font is not a fixed width font. The spacing of characters in this
case is given by the largest character in the font.

.I drawchar
('c')
.LP
Draws the specified character. The character may be either an integer
representing the character of the quoted character itself.

.I drawstr
("string")
.LP
Draws the quoted string of characters. A quote (") itself may be escaped
with a '\' character.

.I rotate
(angle, axis)
.LP
when set will output the rotate keyword with each primitive generated.

.I scale
(xscale, yscale, zscale)
.LP
when set will output the scale keyword with each primitive generated.

.I translate
(xtrans, ytrans, ztrans)
.LP
when set will output the translate keyword with each primitive generated.
