#
# Shell script used by Repository Manager to fix permissions on a newly-created
# repository file so that its permissions match those of the parent directory.
# This script is not designed to be invoked by users directly.
#
# The first parameter should be the full path to the sample data directory,
# including a trailing slash; the second parameter should be the (unqualified)
# name of the data file within the directory whose permissions/ownership are to
# be fixed.

# 07-Nov-2002: ekoperda wrote first draft
# 21-Nov-2002: ekoperda fixed bug #614 by adding code to fail gracefully and
#              write something to syslog in case of error; now we always return
#              error code 0
# 01-Aug-2003: midurbin fixed bug #1007
# 25-Oct-2005: midurbin added code to set the SELinux context
# 27-Feb-2006: jobollin updated comments and reordered code in Mike's solution;
#              this is part of the solution for bug #1549
# 27-Dec-2007: ekoperda fixed bug #1829 by improving detection of SELinux
# 05-Jan-2008: ekoperda fixed bug #1867
