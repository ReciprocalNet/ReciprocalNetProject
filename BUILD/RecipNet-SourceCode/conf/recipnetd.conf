# Reciprocal Net site configuration file - recipnetd.conf
#
# The configuration parameters contained in this file control the
# "core modules" of the Reciprocal Net application on this server.  The core
# modules are the code that runs when you start 'recipnetd', the Reciprocal
# Net daemon.  This file belongs in the /etc/recipnet/ directory on the server.



##############################################################################
# IMPORTANT DIRECTORIES AND FILES
#   These configuration directives tell recipnetd where it can find the files
#   it needs.
##############################################################################

# This is the JAR file that contains the Java classes for recipnetd.
GenRecipnetdClassFile=/usr/share/java/recipnetd.jar

# This is the JAR file that contains the Java classes for many of the
#   command-line utilities that come with Reciprocal Net.

# This is the JAR file that contains the Java classes for your JDBC driver
#   that recipnetd uses to connect to your SQL database engine.

# This is the "site grant" file that has been assigned to this server by the
#   Reciprocal Net coordinator.
SitGrantFile=/etc/recipnet/recipnet.sitegrant

# These directories are used by recipnetd to store inter-site messages in the
#   course of normal operation.
SitMsgsSentDir=/var/recipnet/msgs-sent/
SitMsgsRecvDir=/var/recipnet/msgs-recv/
SitMsgsHeldDir=/var/recipnet/msgs-held/

# This directory is the base of your "file repository", the place where data
#   files associated with Reciprocal Net samples are stored.
RepBaseDirectory=/var/recipnet/data/

# This directory, within your "file repository" area, is dedicated to the
#   exclusive use of CVS file versioning.
RepCvsDirectory=/var/recipnet/data/cvs/

# These paths are to the utilities that recipnetd uses to create data
#   directories and files in the repository.  These utilities are included as
#   part of the recipnet RPM.
RepScriptCreateDir=/usr/bin/recipnet-createreposdir
RepScriptFixFile=/usr/bin/recipnet-fixreposfile

# This is a utility to quickly determine the number of KB stored within a 
# given directory.
RepScriptLabDirSize=/usr/bin/recipnet-getrepositorysize

# This path points to the 'cvs' utility that came with your Linux distribution.
#   Recipnetd invokes this program when versioning sample data files in the
#   repository.
RepCvsCommand=/usr/bin/cvs

# This file will contain important error information if an ISM Generation
# failure occurs
IsmSuicideNote=/tmp/recipnet-ismSuicideNote.txt



##############################################################################
# LOCALLY-DEFINED CUSTOM FIELDS
#   Directives in this section can be used to define custom fields that are
#   attached to sample metadata records.  Metadata stored in those fields
#   is available only to authenticated users at the local site.  The directive
#   format is:
#
#                SitLocalField000=12345,"Field name",65535
#   
#   Replace 000 with any three-digit number (each SitLocalFieldxxx directive
#   must have a distinct number, though), 12345 with the numeric id of the lab
#   hosted at this site that will use the field, and field name with the human-
#   readable name of the field.  65535 should included in every directive.
##############################################################################



##############################################################################
# SAMPLE NUMBER AUTOGENERATION
#
#   Directives in this section can be used to define the automatic id's
#   suggested for new samples from particular labs.
#   The directive formats are:
#
#                SamLocalLabIdPrefixXXXXX="prefix"
#                SamLocalLabIdAutoDigitsXXXXX=5
#   
#   Replace XXXXX with the id for any valid lab hosted at the local site to
#   indicate the lab whose id generation rules are being defined.  The lab id
#   may be fewer than 5 digits long and must be written without any trailing
#   zeros.  The value of SamLocalLabIdPrefix may be any string that will be the
#   start of all suggested sample numbers while the value of
#   SamLocalLabIdAutoDigits will be the number of digits to include for the
#   auto-incrementing number that will be appended to the end.  (ie,
#   prefix00001, prefix00002, etc.)
#
#   When every possible automatic id has been used, localLabId values will no
#   longer be suggested as users submit new samples to the lab.

##############################################################################
# DATABASE OPTIONS
#   These configuration directives tell recipnetd how to connect to your SQL
#   database engine.
##############################################################################

# These directives store the URI of your database server, in a form that JDBC
#   understands.
DbUrl=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/recipnet?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useOldUTF8Behavior=true&autoReconnect=true&jdbcCompliantTruncation=false

# The following is used only when upgrading the site software to version 0.6.2
# from an earlier version.
DbUrlForCharsetUpdate=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/recipnet

# This is the main Java class name of your JDBC driver.
DbDriverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

# These are the database user account names and passwords with which recipnetd
#   connects to your SQL database engine.  Recipnet requires three user
#   accounts to operate.
SitDbUsername=recipnet_site
SitDbPassword=replaceme
SamDbUsername=recipnet_sample
SamDbPassword=replaceme
RepDbUsername=recipnet_repos
RepDbPassword=replaceme

# This is the number of database connections in the pool with which samples
#   are fetched and sample searches are executed.  This number governs the
#   maximum number of sample-related and repository-related operations your
#   site will perform simultaneously.
SamDbConnectionCount=8



##############################################################################
# LOGGING OPTIONS
#   These directives tell recipnetd which of its operations should be logged
#   to syslog, and how.
##############################################################################

# This is the Java class name of the log handler recipnetd should use.  You
#   won't need to change this unless you're a software developer trying to
#   debug something.
handlers=org.recipnet.site.core.util.SyslogHandler

# The minimum severity level of events that should be written to syslog.
#   Possible values are SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST,
#   ALL, and OFF.  Note that this parameter is distinct from actual syslog
#   configuration that you would do in /etc/syslog.conf.  If the syslog service
#   is configured incorrectly, it is conceivable that events reported by
#   recipnetd at certain levels are not actually written to a log file by
#   syslog.
LogLevel=WARNING

# The name of the syslog 'log facility' to use, as defined by syslog's man
#   page.  Possible values (at the time of this writing) are auth, authpriv,
#   cron, daemon, ftp, kern, lpr, mail, news, syslog, user, uucp, and local0
#   to local7.
LogFacility=user

# The textual tag that syslog should attach to every log event that recipnetd
#   originates.  Syslog tags are useful when reading a log whose events
#   came from several programs.  This can be any text.
LogTag=recipnetd

# This can be set to the name of the Java "filter" class that should filter
#   recipnetd's log events before they are sent to syslog.  This should be 
#   blank in most environments.
LogFilter=

# This can be set to the name of the Java "formatter" class that should format
#   recipnetd's log events as they are sent to syslog.  This should be blank
#   in most environments.
LogFormatter=

# Set this to true to enable detailed logging of deadlock-related errors in the
#   locking subsystem.  Performance is much better if this value is false.
SamLockLogStackTraces=false
