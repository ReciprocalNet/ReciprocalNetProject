     <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="explanation" -->Correct!  <a href="http://www.reciprocalnet.org/recipnet/showsample.jsp?sampleId=27344424">Tryptophan</a> is present in turkey and is thought to make you sleepy after a big Thanksgiving Dinner. Tryptophan is a starting material for serotonin, a substance that our brains make, which  then calms us down and makes us sleepy. Tryptophan supplements were used as  popular sleeping aids until 1990, when the substance was banned by the U.S. FDA after a batch of contaminated product manufactured in Japan was associated with many cases of a rare and potentially fatal condition known as <em>eosinophilic myalgia</em>. The thought that the turkey is responsible for the Thanksgiving evening slump is a myth because for tryptophan to have a sedative effect, it must be taken on an empty stomach. More likely, excessive consumption and the carbohydrate-rich diet are responsible for sleepiness. Thryptophan is not only present in turkey meat; it can also be found  for example in milk, beans, and beef.
