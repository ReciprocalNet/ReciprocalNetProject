     <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="explanation" -->Both are correct!  <a href="http://www.reciprocalnet.org/recipnet/showsample.jsp?sampleId=27344304">Ethyl acetate</a> and <a href="http://www.reciprocalnet.org/recipnet/showsample.jsp?sampleId=27344886">acetone</a> are common solvents that may be present in nail polish as well as in nail polish remover; the choice of the solvent depends on the commercial brand. Ethyl acetate and acetone are solvents for the lacquer and pigments that make up nail polish. Nail polish hardens when the solvent evaporates and leaves behind the lacquer, which can be re-dissolved and removed by applying the solvent again. Ethyl acetate has a fruity, pleasant smell and is present in certain fruits but is also used for personal care products and confectionery. Entomologists use it as a very effective poison for insects. The vapor in a closed jar will kill the collected insects quickly and keep them soft for mounting.
