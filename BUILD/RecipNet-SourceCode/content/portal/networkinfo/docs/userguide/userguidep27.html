</div>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a new Reciprocal Net site
software installation, it’s necessary to perform a few administrative tasks
before samples can be submitted.  Open a
web browser and go to <a
href="http://www.yourserver.edu/recipnet">http://www.yourserver.edu/recipnet/</a></span>
.  (You may open the web browser on any
Internet-connected computer; it need not be your Reciprocal Net server.)  Log in with the <I>site
administrator</I> credentials you specified in the previous
chapter.  A few new choices should appear
on the web app’s menu bar.  Notice also
that the name of your user account appears on the right side of the menu bar as
a reminder to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Click on <B><I>Administrative Tools</B></I>
to go to the main page for administrative tasks.  From the screen that appears, click on <B><I>Manage Labs</B></I>.  (The <B><I>Manage Labs</B></I> link is the only link
on that page that is functional in this release.)  You should see a list of every lab in the
Reciprocal Net Site Network.  Click the
link next to your lab that says <B><I>Edit this lab</B></I>.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The top portion of this page
contains some technical information about your lab record that you probably
won’t ever need to change.  The bottom
portion of the page contains a list of every user account that is associated
with your lab.  (In a new site software
installation, the only account in the list will be the <I>site
administrator</I> account that was created in the previous
chapter.)  Normally you will want to
create individual user accounts for every employee who works in your
crystallography lab.  The way to do this
is to click the <B><I>Add a
new user</B></I> link.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the form that appears,
type the user’s full name, username, and desired password.  The latter two fields are limited to eight
characters.  You should be sure to set
the user’s <B><I>Global
access level</B></I> appropriately. 
For example, crystallographers who work in your lab probably should be <B><I>Scientific users</B></I>,
while secretaries whom you enlist to help run your lab probably are not.  You should think carefully before delegating <B><I>Lab administrator</B></I>
and <B><I>Site administrator</B></I>
privileges to others: while there is no limit to the number of each type of
user that can exist, users with these privileges will have access to the <B><I>Administrative Tools</B></I>
module that you’re using right now.  This
means that they could create new user accounts or even deactivate your lab
inadvertently.  The only difference
between a <B><I>Site
Administrator</B></I> and a <B><I>Lab Administrator</B></I> is that the
latter can administer only his own lab, while the former can administer any lab
that’s hosted on the site.  Click <B><I>Submit</B></I> when
you’re done filling out the form.  The
newly-created user account should now appear on the list of users associated
with your lab.  Repeat this procedure
until all your lab employees have their own user accounts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next step is to create <I>provider
records</I> for every person or group that submits crystal
samples to your lab.  A single provider
must be associated with every sample that you create in Reciprocal Net, and you
must create at least one provider record before you can create new
samples.  If you aren’t prepared to key all
your providers into the system right now, just create a provider record called “Miscellaneous”
or something similar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To create a new provider,
click <B><I>Administrative Tools</B></I>
in the menu bar, then <B><I>Manage
Labs</B></I>, and then <B><I>Manage this lab’s providers</B></I>.  (Provider records only make sense when
considered in the context of the lab that created them; this is because
providers do not have direct involvement with Reciprocal Net in the same way
that labs do.)  The list of providers
associated with the lab should be displayed; it will be empty if this is a new
installation.  Click <B><I>Add a new provider</B></I>.  Name the provider something informative (like
“Dr. Laue’s group”) and specify the head contact (Max Laue) in the next
box.  If your provider consists of only a
single person, and not an entire research group, then it probably would make
sense for you to leave the <B><I>Provider
Head Contact</B></I> field blank. 
Enter any comments you like and then click the <B><I>Submit</B></I> button.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now go back to the list of
providers associated with your lab and click the <B><I>Edit this provider</B></I> link.  You should see that data you entered before,
and at the bottom of the form a list of user accounts associated with the
provider.  Creating user accounts for a
provider is an optional step.  You might
do it if you wanted the sample provider to be able to access on your server the
samples he submitted, giving him a quick and relatively painless link to the
data files you created on his behalf. 
It’s your choice whether you create a single user account that is shared
by every person in the provider’s research group, or whether you create
individual user accounts for each member of the group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you’re all done, click <B><I>Home</B></I> to
conclude your tour of the <B><I>Administrative
Tools</B></I>.</p>
