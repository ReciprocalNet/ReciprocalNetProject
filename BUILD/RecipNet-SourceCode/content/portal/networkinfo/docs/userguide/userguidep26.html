<p class=MsoNormal>It will be useful to become
familiar with some basic terminology that will be used in this chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A <I>sample</I>
is the basic data entity in this system; this is what the Reciprocal Net site
software tracks.  <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Crystal</st1:City></st1:place> samples usually are grown by one
particular <I>sample provider</I> (the lab of a
research chemist) and subsequently submitted to one particular <I>crystallography
lab </I>for processing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><I>Structures</I> may be contrasted with samples in that while one
sample always illustrates one molecular structure, it is conceivable that two
samples in Reciprocal Net would have the same underlying molecular
structure.  Generally, a <I>duplicate
flag</I> is added to both samples when such a condition is discovered.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now that we’ve already used
the term we might as well define it: a <I>lab</I> is a
participating crystallography laboratory that uses the Reciprocal Net site
software for its daily operations (like you probably hope to do).  Most management features of the Reciprocal
Net Site Network take place at the lab level. 
For this reason, each sample has a data field where the originating lab
is recorded at the time of sample creation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A <I>provider</I>
is generally the lab of a research chemist that grows crystal samples and
submits them to your lab for analysis. 
There frequently are multiple people associated with a single provider,
perhaps one faculty member and several graduate students.  Each sample has a data field where the
originating provider is recorded at the time of sample creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A <I>site</I>
is a server (or cluster of servers) in the Reciprocal Net Site Network.  More specifically, a site is a web server
that runs the Reciprocal Net site software and is connected to the Internet.  It is possible for a single site to host
multiple labs.  All sites in the network
communicate with one another over the Internet to keep the distributed database
of publicly visible samples in a consistent and accessible state.  Sites also                              maintain their own
collection of private samples that are not shared with other sites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <I>site
database</I> is a SQL database that exists at each site and that contains
metadata about samples in the Reciprocal Net Site Network.  The database contains records for every
sample that exists on the local site, plus those samples at other (remote)
sites that have been made available to the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <I>site
repository</I> contains actual data files for samples in Reciprocal
Net and is stored on the server’s file system directly.  These data files might include <B><I>.cif</B></I> files, <B><I>.sdt</B></I> files, <B><I>.ort</B></I> files, <B><I>.crt</B></I> files, <B><I>.pdb</B></I> files, and
so forth.  To recap: the site database
contains <I>metadata</I>, the site repository
contains <I>data</I>.</p>
