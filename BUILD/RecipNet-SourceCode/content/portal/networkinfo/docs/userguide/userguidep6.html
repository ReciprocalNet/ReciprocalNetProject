<p class=MsoNormal>The
instructions in this chapter will direct the reader through a complete
installation beginning with an empty hard disk drive.  It will address installation and
configuration of an operating system (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1 Server i386),
Reciprocal Net site software, and the recommended supporting packages (Apache
Httpd, Apache Tomcat, MySQL, Sun’s Java SDK, etc.).  The instructions describe one way to assemble
a Reciprocal Net site but there are many more. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Substitution
of a “clone” distribution of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, such as CentOS or
Scientific Linux, is straightforward.  In
most cases only the on-screen textual labels have changed.  These instructions will address the few key
distinctions as they arise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Experienced
system administrators may opt to deviate from these instructions more
dramatically still to suit local preferences, but should bear in mind that such
deviations may frustrate the Reciprocal Net project’s efforts to assist them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is assumed
that existing Reciprocal Net sites will take advantage of this opportunity to
upgrade their server’s operating system and perhaps even to upgrade their
server’s hardware.  (An unfortunate
consequence of three years having elapsed since release 0.6.2 is that PC
hardware and software standards have progressed considerably.)   For this reason, the procedure for
installing a new Reciprocal Net site is similar to that for upgrading an
existing Reciprocal Net site.  Both
procedures are described by this chapter, with colored flags in the left margin
signifying instructions applicable to only one procedure or the other.</p>
