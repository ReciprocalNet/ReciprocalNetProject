<p class=MsoNormal>The <B><I>recipnet.sitegrant</B></I> file is a
binary configuration file that must be present on every site in Reciprocal Net.  Every <B><I>recipnet.sitegrant</B></I> file is unique
and custom-built for the site.  It’s not
part of the standard software distribution – after you install the <B><I>recipnet</B></I> RPM on
your server, you’ll need to obtain a <B><I>recipnet.sitegrant</B></I> file from the
Reciprocal Net Coordinator and place it in your <B><I>/etc/recipnet/</B></I> directory.  Only the Reciprocal Net Coordinator can issue
these <I>site grant</I> files.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <B><I>recipnet.sitegrant</B></I> file contains
important initialization data specific to your site.  The most important elements are your site’s
unique identification number, your site’s encryption keys, and the identity of
the Coordinator.  Reciprocal Net is a
distributed system and therefore requires that id numbers of its data items be
unique.  Centralized creation of <B><I>recipnet.sitegrant</B></I>
files by the Coordinator ensures that there are no duplicate site numbers, lab
numbers, or sample numbers, and that every site knows how to communicate with
every other site.  It is important to
understand that this file is <I>not</I>
intended to be a licensing scheme of any sort – Reciprocal Net is 100% free and
open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A <B><I>recipnet.sitegrant</B></I>
file contains a site’s encryption key pair, although this might seem curious at
first glance.  Reciprocal Net sites are
able to exchange messages with one another across the Internet, and for
security reasons, cryptographic digital signatures are added to every message
and verified by receiving sites. 
Encryption keys are necessary for this to work.  Reciprocal Net does not have mechanisms for
encrypting data so that it cannot be read by others in transit (nor does it
need them), only for signing messages so that they cannot be tampered with by
crackers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your site stores its private encryption key in the
file <B><I>recipnet.sitegrant</B></I>.  Therefore, it is important that you secure
this file and prevent unauthorized access. 
At minimum, you should set permissions on this file so that only the
user <B><I>recipnet</B></I>
can read it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <B><I>recipnet.sitegrant</B></I> file isn’t
obscured deliberately, but it does contain a lot of compressed binary data like
encryption keys and so forth.  There are
no settings in this file that affect how your server behaves; all of Reciprocal
Net’s configuration parameters are stored in <B><I>recipnetd.conf</B></I>, which is
human-readable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently the Coordinator function is being performed
by the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Molecular</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Structure</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType> at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Indiana</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.  To obtain a <I>site grant</I>
file for your site, send an e-mail to Dr. Maren Pink (<a
href="mailto:info@reciprocalnet.org"><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc20190708'><span
>info@reciprocalnet.org</a>) telling her that wish to turn your server into a
Reciprocal Net site.  She’ll contact you
offline (probably via telephone or videoconference) just to say hello and to
arrange for the file exchange.  The
process normally takes a couple of business days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We hope to create an automated mechanism at some point
in the future for registering new sites and obtaining <B><I>recipnet.sitegrant</B></I>
files.</p>
