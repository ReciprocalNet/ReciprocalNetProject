            <p>The Reciprocal Net Site Network is an online community that maintains a distributed 
             database of crystallographic information. Its membership includes 
             crystallographic service facilities (that analyze crystals submitted by research 
             chemists) located at major universities. These labs analyze anywhere from 
             a few dozen to several hundred molecular structures each year and post the data 
             online for the public to access. A distributed database engine takes care 
             of shuttling this data across the Internet so that every structure can be 
             located by <a href="/recipnet/search.jsp" target="_blank" onclick="openNewWindow(this.href); return false" onkeypress="openNewWindow(this.href); return false;">the search engine</a>  at Reciprocalnet.org.&nbsp; 
             Frequently there may be a delay of a year or more between the time a structure 
             is first analyzed and the time it finally becomes available for the public to 
             see. This is due to intellectual property issues - the intervening time 
             allows the chemists who first discovered the structure to publish it in a trade journal.
            </p>

            <p>The Reciprocal Net Site Network is the source of Reciprocal 
             Net's molecular structure data. An active volunteer base ensures the 
             viability of Reciprocal Net as an educational resource with outstanding value. 
             This server at Reciprocalnet.org is the master server in the Site Network. 
             Currently it's hosted by Indiana University's Molecular Structure Center because 
             it is they who were awarded the NSF grant that jumpstarted Reciprocal Net. 
             Efforts are underway to transition to a self-supporting, community-managed model.

            <div class="boxDivThin1">
            <p>The Reciprocal Net project, so far as the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) is concerned, 
            comprises three collections:
            </p>

            <ul>
             <li>A collection of molecular structures, solved and ready to 
             be visualized. Submissions into this collection originate from respected 
             service crystallography facilities, generally affiliated with major 
             universities.
             </li>

             <li>A collection of educational modules &ndash; sequences of web 
             pages &ndash; that instruct students on specific aspects of chemistry. Submissions 
             into this collection originate from professional educators in primary schools, 
             secondary schools, and universities.
             </li>
	
             <li>A collection of visualization programs for rendering 
             molecular structures. Submissions into this collection generally originate 
             from computer programmers associated with the field of chemistry in some way.
             </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The latter two collections are managed entirely by 
            Reciprocalnet.org, this site; it is the first collection (of molecular 
            structures) that draws upon the resources of the Reciprocal Net Site Network.
            </p>
           </div><br/><br/>

           <div class="boxDivThin1">
            <p>It will be useful to become familiar with some basic terminology. </p>

            <ul>
             <li>A <strong>sample</strong> is the basic data entity in this collection; this is what the Reciprocal Net Site Network 
             tracks. Crystal samples usually are grown by one particular
             sample provider (the lab of a research 
             chemist) and subsequently submitted to one particular service
             crystallography lab for processing.
             </li>

             <li><strong>Structure</strong>s may be contrasted with samples in that while one 
             sample always illustrates one molecular structure, it is conceivable that two 
             samples in Reciprocal Net would have the same underlying molecular structure. 
             Generally, a duplicate flag is added to both 
             samples when such a condition is discovered.
             </li>
	
             <li>A <strong>lab</strong> is a participating crystallography laboratory that uses the Reciprocal Net site software for its 
             daily operations. Most management features of the Reciprocal Net Site Network 
             take place at the lab level. For this reason, each sample has a data field 
             where the originating lab is recorded at the 
             time of sample creation.
             </li>
	
             <li>A <strong>site</strong> is a server (or cluster of servers) in the Reciprocal Net Site Network. More specifically, a 
             site is a web server that runs the Reciprocal Net site software and is connected to the Internet. It is possible for a 
             single site to host multiple labs (perhaps in an outsourced Application 
             Service Provider model). All sites in the network communicate with one 
             another over the Internet to keep the distributed database of publicly visible 
             samples in a consistent and accessible state. Sites may also maintain their 
             own collection of private samples that are not shared with other sites.
             </li>
	
             <li>The <strong>site database</strong> contains metadata about samples in Reciprocal 
             Net and is stored in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) like MySQL.
             </li>

             <li>The <strong>site repository</strong> contains actual data files for samples in Reciprocal Net and is stored on the 
             server's file system directly. These data files might include .CIF files, .SDT 
             files, .ORT files, .CRT files, .PDB files, and so forth. The
             site database contains metadata, the site repository contains data.
             </li>

            </ul>
           </div><br/><br/>
					 
           <div class="boxDivThin1">
            <p>When the recipnet package is installed on a server, the server becomes a site in the Reciprocal Net Site 
            Network and may begin contributing to the Reciprocal Net molecular structure 
            collection. <a href="docs/index.html">Documentation elsewhere on 
            this site</a> can assist new users in getting their site up and running.
            In the Reciprocal Net site network there are two 
            distinguished (i.e. unusual) sites.</p>

             <ul>
              <li><strong>The first is Reciprocalnet.org, the &quot;portal&quot;</strong>. This is 
              just another site so far as the recipnet software 
              package is concerned, but this server runs additional software that provides a 
              network-wide search engine for samples that have been made public. This means 
              that the search engine on Reciprocalnet.org may link visitors to your site if 
              their search finds a matching, publicly-visible structure on it.
              </li>

              <li><strong>The second is the Reciprocal Net Coordinator</strong>. This is a 
              deliberately ephemeral and portable entity that helps all the other sites in 
              the Reciprocal Net Site Network communicate with one another and maintain a 
              consistent distributed database. The Reciprocal Net Coordinator is the only 
              site that does not operate a web server. Most of the work of the Reciprocal 
              Net Coordinator takes place behind-the-scenes; about the only interaction 
              you'll ever have with this entity is when you first bring your site online. 
              Currently the Coordinator function is being served by the people at the 
              Molecular Structure Center at Indiana University, but this may change in the future.
